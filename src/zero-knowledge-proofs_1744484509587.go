		Summary: Proves the integrity of data (or a part of data) without revealing the content of the data itself.  Commonly uses Merkle trees.

		Prover Input: Data block or file, Merkle tree (constructed from the data), Merkle path to the data block
		Verifier Input: Merkle root (public), Data block (potentially public or known to verifier)
		Common Knowledge: Merkle tree construction method, Hash function

		Steps (Merkle Tree Based):
		1. Prover constructs a Merkle tree from the data, where each leaf node is a hash of a data block, and internal nodes are hashes of their children. The root of the tree is the Merkle root.
		2. Prover makes the Merkle root public.
		3. To prove the integrity of a specific data block, the prover provides the data block itself and the Merkle path from the leaf node corresponding to that block up to the Merkle root.
		4. Verifier checks the integrity by:
		   a. Hashing the provided data block.
		   b. Recomputing the hashes along the Merkle path using the provided path and the hashes in the path.
		   c. Verifying that the recomputed root matches the publicly known Merkle root.

		Output:
		- Proof Data: Data block, Merkle path.
		- Verification Result: Boolean indicating if the data block's integrity is verified against the Merkle root.

		Use Case: Secure data storage and retrieval, content delivery networks (CDNs) verifying data integrity, blockchain data verification, ensuring data has not been tampered with without revealing the data content itself for verification.

// 19. Proof of No Collusion in Distributed Systems
// Proves that nodes in a distributed system are not colluding (e.g., in voting or consensus).
func ProofNoCollusion() {
	/*
		Summary: Proves that nodes in a distributed system are acting independently and not colluding with each other, which is crucial in scenarios like voting, auctions, or distributed consensus.

		Prover (Nodes in system) Input: Randomness source (private per node), Actions or votes of the node
		Verifier Input: Public commitments from each node (to randomness or actions), Aggregated outcomes (e.g., vote tally)
		Common Knowledge: Protocol for non-collusion proof (e.g., verifiable secret sharing, distributed key generation), System parameters

		Steps (Example using Verifiable Secret Sharing):
		1. Each node generates a random secret and shares it using Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) among all nodes.
		2. Each node commits to their action or vote, potentially using their shared secret or derived randomness.
		3. Nodes collectively reconstruct their shared secrets (or parts of them) in a verifiable way.
		4. Using the reconstructed secrets and commitments, a proof is generated demonstrating that each node acted based on their independent randomness and commitments, and not in coordination with others.
		   This proof might involve showing that the randomness sources were independently generated and used in a way that prevents pre-computation or coordinated action.
		5. Verifiers (observers or designated nodes) check the proof to ensure no collusion.

		Output:
		- Proof Data: Cryptographic proof of no collusion.
		- Verification Result: Boolean indicating if no collusion is verified.

		Use Case: Secure voting systems, fair auctions, robust distributed consensus mechanisms, preventing manipulation or attacks in distributed environments where node independence is critical.

// 20. Proof of Correct Database Query Result without Revealing Query or Database
// Proves the result of a database query is correct without revealing the query itself or the entire database content.
func ProofCorrectDatabaseQueryResult() {
	/*
		Summary: Proves that a database query result is correct without revealing the query itself, the database content, or sensitive data within the database.

		Prover (Database Server) Input: Database, Query (secret), Query result, Witness of query execution (e.g., execution trace)
		Verifier Input: Query result, Commitment to the database (or relevant parts)
		Common Knowledge: Database schema (potentially public or partially public), ZKP scheme for database queries

		Steps:
		1. Database server commits to the database (or relevant parts) in a way that allows for ZKP verification (e.g., using Merkle trees, vector commitments).
		2. Database server executes the query and obtains the result.
		3. Database server constructs a ZKP demonstrating that the provided query result is indeed the correct output of applying the (secret) query to the committed database.
		   This proof needs to be constructed in a way that it does not reveal the query itself or the entire database content, but only proves the correctness of the specific result.
		   Techniques like zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs could be adapted for proving database query execution in zero-knowledge.
		4. Database server sends the proof and the query result to the verifier.
		5. Verifier checks the proof against the query result and the commitment to the database.

		Output:
		- Proof Data: Cryptographic proof of correct query result.
		- Query Result: Public query result.
		- Verification Result: Boolean indicating if the query result is verified as correct.

		Use Case: Privacy-preserving data analytics, enabling users to verify database query results without trusting the database server or revealing their queries or the entire database to the verifier. Secure APIs where clients can verify server responses without full transparency into server-side data.

// 21. Proof of AI Model Robustness against Adversarial Attacks (limited proof type)
//  Proves a certain level of robustness of an AI model against specific adversarial examples without fully revealing the model.
func ProofAIModelRobustness() {
	/*
		Summary: Provides a limited form of proof that an AI model is robust against specific types of adversarial attacks, without fully revealing the model's internal parameters or architecture. This is a challenging area and proofs might be tailored to specific attack types and robustness definitions.

		Prover (Model Owner) Input: AI Model parameters (secret), Set of adversarial examples, Correct model predictions on original inputs
		Verifier Input: Set of adversarial examples, Original inputs, Correct predictions on original inputs
		Common Knowledge: Model architecture (public), Definition of robustness (e.g., adversarial perturbation threshold)

		Steps (Example approach - not a full ZKP in all senses, but demonstrates a proof concept):
		1. Model owner pre-computes and commits to the model's performance against a specific set of adversarial examples. This might involve creating commitments to the model's output on these adversarial examples.
		2. To prove robustness against *these specific* adversarial examples, the model owner provides a proof that the model's predictions on the adversarial examples are still "close enough" to the original correct predictions (according to a defined robustness metric).
		   This proof might involve revealing *some* information about the model's behavior on these specific inputs, but aiming to minimize information leakage about the model's general parameters.  Techniques could include range proofs on the difference in predictions, or selectively revealing parts of the model's computation path for these adversarial examples.
		3. Verifier checks the proof against the provided adversarial examples, original inputs, and correct predictions, and the defined robustness metric.

		Output:
		- Proof Data: Cryptographic proof of robustness (limited to specific adversarial examples).
		- Verification Result: Boolean indicating if the model is verified as robust against the provided adversarial examples, according to the defined metric.

		Use Case: Certification of AI model security and trustworthiness in specific contexts, providing some level of assurance against known adversarial attack types without fully open-sourcing the model. This is a research area, and practical ZKP for general AI robustness is still under development. This function aims to represent a *trendy* and *advanced* concept even if a fully robust ZKP solution is not yet readily available.
