**Important Notes:**

*   **Simplified Implementations:** These functions are simplified for demonstration and educational purposes. They are NOT intended for production use in real-world security-critical applications.
*   **Security:** Real-world ZKP requires robust cryptographic libraries and careful design to ensure security. This code uses basic hashing and simplified logic for illustrative purposes.
*   **No External Libraries:**  This code aims to be self-contained and avoids external cryptographic libraries for clarity and to fulfill the "no duplication of open source" requirement. In practice, use well-vetted crypto libraries.
*   **Witness:** The `witness` parameter in many functions is a placeholder for data that the prover needs to generate the proof but is not revealed to the verifier. In real ZKP, witnesses are crucial and managed cryptographically.
*   **Conceptual Focus:** The primary goal is to demonstrate the *concept* of ZKP and its potential applications, not to provide production-ready cryptographic implementations.

**Explanation and Important Notes:**

1.  **Simplified Implementations:** As highlighted in the comments, all the ZKP functions are significantly simplified for demonstration purposes. They are not cryptographically secure and should not be used in real-world applications requiring actual ZKP security.

2.  **Conceptual Focus:** The primary aim is to illustrate the *concept* of Zero-Knowledge Proof in various scenarios. The focus is on showing how you can prove something (like being above a certain age, owning a document, etc.) without revealing the sensitive information itself (exact age, document content, etc.).

3.  **`witness` Parameter:** The `witness string` parameter in many `Prove...` functions is a placeholder. In real ZKP, a witness is the secret information that the prover possesses and uses to generate the proof.  In these simplified examples, the `witness` is often just a string added to the data being hashed, which doesn't represent a true cryptographic witness mechanism.

4.  **Verification is Placeholder:** The `Verify...` functions in many cases are extremely simplified and often return `true` without doing actual cryptographic verification.  In real ZKP, the verification process is mathematically rigorous and depends on the structure of the proof and cryptographic properties.  The simplified verification here is just to show the flow of prover and verifier interaction.

5.  **Hashing for Simplicity:**  The code uses `sha256` hashing, but even this is used in a basic way. Real ZKP protocols often involve more complex cryptographic primitives, mathematical structures (like elliptic curves, pairing-based cryptography), and interactive protocols.

6.  **No External Libraries (as requested):** The code is self-contained and doesn't use external ZKP libraries to fulfill the "no duplication of open source" requirement and for simplicity. However, in real-world ZKP development, you would *absolutely* use well-established and audited cryptographic libraries and ZKP frameworks.

7.  **Security Disclaimer:** **This code is NOT secure for real-world ZKP applications.** It is purely for educational demonstration.  Building secure ZKP systems requires deep cryptographic expertise and careful implementation using robust libraries.

**To extend and explore further (still within the realm of simplified demonstrations):**

*   **More Realistic Range Proof:** You could try to implement a slightly more structured (though still simplified) range proof using commitments and challenges, inspired by techniques used in real range proofs.
*   **Set Membership with Hashing:**  You could explore using a simplified Merkle tree concept (without full cryptographic rigor) to demonstrate set membership proofs more effectively.
*   **Interactive Proofs (Simplified):**  You could introduce a basic form of interaction (challenge-response) into some of the proofs to better reflect how many ZKP protocols work in practice.
*   **Different Hashing/Transformation Functions:** Experiment with different ways of transforming and combining data in the `Prove...` and `Verify...` functions to understand how proof construction works conceptually.

Remember that moving from these simplified demonstrations to actual secure ZKP implementations is a significant step that requires in-depth knowledge of cryptography and careful engineering.
