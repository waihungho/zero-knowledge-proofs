Outline and Function Summary:

This Go code implements a suite of Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) functions, exploring advanced concepts beyond basic demonstrations.
The functions are designed to be creative and trendy, focusing on applications in modern digital systems and privacy-preserving technologies.
It avoids duplication of existing open-source ZKP libraries by focusing on conceptual implementations and unique use cases.

Note: These functions are conceptual and outline the ZKP idea.  Implementing robust and cryptographically secure versions of these would require significant cryptographic expertise and likely utilize established ZKP libraries for efficiency and security in real-world scenarios. This code focuses on demonstrating the *logic* and *possibilities* of ZKP in Go.

	// For a *real* Range Proof, look at Pedersen Commitments and more advanced protocols.
	// Here, we are just illustrating the *idea* of proving something about a secret without revealing it in full in a very simplified way.

// --- Further Implementation Notes and Next Steps ---

// To fully implement these ZKP concepts in a cryptographically sound manner, you would need to:
// 1.  Use established cryptographic libraries for secure primitives (e.g., elliptic curve cryptography, pairings).
// 2.  Implement proper commitment schemes (e.g., Pedersen commitments).
// 3.  Design challenge-response protocols for each ZKP function.
// 4.  Consider using existing ZKP frameworks or libraries in Go (though the request was to avoid duplication, understanding existing libraries is crucial for real-world implementations).
// 5.  For complex NP-complete problem proofs (Graph Coloring, Hamiltonian Cycle, SAT), explore techniques like Fiat-Shamir heuristic or more advanced ZKP constructions.
// 6.  For proofs involving computation or machine learning models, research techniques related to verifiable computation and secure multi-party computation (MPC).
// 7.  For practical applications, efficiency (proof size, verification time) is crucial. Explore optimized ZKP techniques like zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs for specific use cases (though these are more complex to implement from scratch).

// This code is a starting point to understand the *conceptual* basis of various advanced ZKP applications.
// Real-world ZKP implementations require deep cryptographic knowledge and careful security considerations.
