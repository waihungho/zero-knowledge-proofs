Okay, here is a Go implementation demonstrating various conceptual Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) functions.

**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**
This code is a **conceptual and simulated implementation** designed to illustrate the *types of problems* ZKPs can solve and provide *examples of diverse ZKP applications* in Go. It **DOES NOT implement actual cryptographic ZKP schemes** (like zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs, etc.). Implementing secure and efficient ZKP primitives requires deep cryptographic expertise and involves complex mathematics (elliptic curves, polynomial commitments, etc.) and is typically done within highly optimized libraries.

The `Prove` functions here contain placeholder logic (`// Simulate ZKP proof generation...`) and the `Verify` functions contain placeholder verification logic. A real ZKP library would replace these placeholders with rigorous cryptographic algorithms.

The goal is to show the *API* and *application scenarios* of ZKPs, not the intricate low-level cryptography.
