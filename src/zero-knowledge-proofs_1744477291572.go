Outline and Function Summary:

Package: zkplib - Zero-Knowledge Proof Library

This library provides a collection of advanced and creative Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) functions in Go, designed for a "Decentralized Secure Credential and Reputation System".  It goes beyond basic ZKP demonstrations and aims to implement functionalities for a practical, trendy application.  This system allows users to prove properties about their credentials and reputation without revealing the underlying data itself.

Function Summary (20+ Functions):

1.  **GenerateCredentialProof(credentialData, proofRequest): (proof, err)**
    - Generates a ZKP demonstrating possession of a credential and satisfying a specific proof request (e.g., age > 18, country of origin).  Credential data is kept private.

2.  **VerifyCredentialProof(proof, proofRequest, trustedVerifierPublicKey): (isValid, err)**
    - Verifies a generated credential proof against the original proof request and using a trusted verifier's public key.  Ensures the proof is valid and comes from a legitimate source.

3.  **GenerateReputationScoreProof(reputationData, threshold): (proof, err)**
    - Creates a ZKP showing that a user's reputation score is above a certain threshold without revealing the exact score. Reputation data remains confidential.

4.  **VerifyReputationScoreProof(proof, threshold, reputationVerifierPublicKey): (isValid, err)**
    - Verifies the reputation score proof, ensuring the score is indeed above the threshold as claimed and verified by a designated authority.

5.  **ProveCredentialAttributeRange(credentialData, attributeName, minVal, maxVal): (proof, err)**
    - Generates a ZKP proving that a specific attribute in the credential data falls within a specified range [minVal, maxVal] without revealing the exact attribute value.

6.  **VerifyCredentialAttributeRangeProof(proof, attributeName, minVal, maxVal, verifierPublicKey): (isValid, err)**
    - Verifies the range proof for a credential attribute, confirming it lies within the claimed range.

7.  **ProveCredentialAttributeMembership(credentialData, attributeName, allowedValues): (proof, err)**
    - Creates a ZKP demonstrating that a specific attribute in the credential data belongs to a predefined set of allowed values, without revealing the exact value.

8.  **VerifyCredentialAttributeMembershipProof(proof, attributeName, allowedValues, verifierPublicKey): (isValid, err)**
    - Verifies the membership proof, ensuring the attribute value is indeed part of the allowed set.

9.  **ProveCredentialAttributeComparison(credentialData1, attributeName1, credentialData2, attributeName2, comparisonType): (proof, err)**
    - Generates a ZKP proving a comparison relationship (e.g., greater than, less than, equal to) between attributes from two different credentials, without disclosing the attribute values themselves.

10. **VerifyCredentialAttributeComparisonProof(proof, attributeName1, attributeName2, comparisonType, verifierPublicKey): (isValid, err)**
    - Verifies the comparison proof between credential attributes, confirming the claimed relationship holds true.

11. **GenerateAnonymousCredentialSignature(credentialData, issuerPrivateKey): (signature, err)**
    - Creates an anonymous digital signature for credential data by the issuer, allowing verifiers to confirm the credential's authenticity without identifying the signer in detail beyond issuer identity.

12. **VerifyAnonymousCredentialSignature(credentialData, signature, issuerPublicKey): (isValid, err)**
    - Verifies the anonymous signature of a credential, ensuring it was issued by the legitimate authority without revealing further details about the signing process.

13. **ProveCredentialRevocationStatus(credentialData, revocationList): (proof, err)**
    - Generates a ZKP proving that a credential is *not* in a provided revocation list, without revealing the credential itself or the entire revocation list to the verifier in a naive way. (Uses efficient revocation techniques conceptually).

14. **VerifyCredentialRevocationStatusProof(proof, revocationListVerifierPublicKey): (isValid, err)**
    - Verifies the revocation status proof, confirming the credential is not revoked according to the trusted revocation list authority.

15. **ProveCredentialExistence(credentialIdentifier): (proof, err)**
    - Creates a ZKP demonstrating the existence of a credential associated with a given identifier within a credential system, without revealing the actual credential data.

16. **VerifyCredentialExistenceProof(proof, credentialSystemPublicKey): (isValid, err)**
    - Verifies the existence proof, confirming that a credential with the given identifier is indeed registered within the system.

17. **GenerateSelectiveDisclosureProof(credentialData, attributesToDisclose, proofRequest): (proof, err)**
    - Allows for selective disclosure of specific attributes from a credential while still proving other properties through ZKP based on the `proofRequest`.  Only the `attributesToDisclose` are revealed, others remain private.

18. **VerifySelectiveDisclosureProof(proof, attributesToDisclose, proofRequest, verifierPublicKey): (isValid, err)**
    - Verifies the selective disclosure proof, ensuring the disclosed attributes are valid and the ZKP for the hidden attributes is also satisfied.

19. **ProveZeroKnowledgeAuthorization(actionRequest, policyRules): (proof, err)**
    - Generates a ZKP demonstrating that a user is authorized to perform a specific action based on a set of policy rules associated with their credentials, without revealing the exact credentials or the full policy.

20. **VerifyZeroKnowledgeAuthorizationProof(proof, policyRulesVerifierPublicKey): (isValid, err)**
    - Verifies the authorization proof, confirming the user is indeed authorized according to the policy rules and their implicit credentials.

21. **GenerateComposableZKProof(proof1, proof2, compositionType): (compositeProof, err)** // Advanced: Proof Composition
    - Combines two existing ZK proofs (`proof1`, `proof2`) using a specified composition type (e.g., AND, OR) into a single composite proof. This allows for building more complex ZK statements from simpler ones.

22. **VerifyComposableZKProof(compositeProof, compositionType, verifierPublicKey): (isValid, err)** // Advanced: Proof Composition Verification
    - Verifies a composable ZK proof, ensuring that the underlying composed proofs are valid according to the specified composition type.

Note: This is a conceptual outline and function summary.  Implementing these functions would require significant cryptographic expertise and the use of appropriate ZKP libraries and techniques (like zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs, etc. depending on the efficiency and security requirements for each function). The code below provides function signatures and placeholder comments to illustrate the structure.

**Explanation and Key Concepts Illustrated:**

1.  **Decentralized Secure Credential and Reputation System:** The functions are designed around a practical use case, making the ZKP concepts more tangible. This system allows users to manage and prove properties about their digital identities and reputations in a privacy-preserving way.

2.  **Beyond Simple Demonstrations:** The functions are more advanced than basic "prove you know a secret." They address real-world credential management scenarios:
    *   **Proof Requests:**  Verifiers can specify what properties they need to be proven (age, country, reputation threshold) without needing the raw data.
    *   **Range Proofs, Membership Proofs, Comparison Proofs:**  These functions showcase how to prove specific types of relationships about data without revealing the data itself.
    *   **Anonymous Signatures:**  Demonstrate how credentials can be issued and verified anonymously, enhancing privacy.
    *   **Revocation Status Proofs:**  Crucial for real-world credential systems, showing how to prove a credential is still valid (not revoked) without revealing the entire revocation list.
    *   **Selective Disclosure:**  Allows users to reveal only necessary attributes of their credentials, minimizing data exposure.
    *   **Zero-Knowledge Authorization:**  Demonstrates how ZKP can be used for access control based on implicit credential properties.
    *   **Composable Proofs (Advanced):**  Introduces the concept of combining ZKP statements, allowing for more complex and flexible ZKP-based systems.

3.  **Trendy and Creative:** The concept of a decentralized secure credential and reputation system is very relevant in today's world of digital identity, data privacy, and Web3. The functions are designed to be useful and address modern challenges.

4.  **No Duplication of Open Source (Conceptual):** While the *concepts* of ZKP are well-established, the specific set of functions and their application to this "Decentralized Secure Credential and Reputation System" are designed to be a unique combination.  The code itself is a conceptual outline and does not duplicate any *specific* open-source library implementation, as it focuses on function signatures and high-level descriptions of the ZKP logic.

5.  **Placeholder Comments:** The code uses `// --- Placeholder for ZKP logic ---` extensively. This is intentional. Implementing the *actual* ZKP cryptographic algorithms within each function would require a deep dive into specific ZKP techniques (zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs, etc.) and potentially using external cryptographic libraries.  The focus of this example is to demonstrate the *application* and *functionality* of ZKP in a creative and advanced way, not to provide a fully working, production-ready ZKP library in this single response.

**To make this a fully functional library, you would need to:**

1.  **Choose specific ZKP cryptographic schemes** for each function (e.g., Bulletproofs for range proofs, zk-SNARKs for general proofs, accumulator-based methods for revocation).
2.  **Integrate with a suitable cryptographic library in Go** that supports the chosen ZKP schemes (or implement the schemes from scratch if necessary, which is a very complex task).
3.  **Implement the actual ZKP logic** within each function, replacing the placeholder comments with the cryptographic code.
4.  **Define concrete data structures** for `CredentialData`, `ReputationData`, `ProofRequest`, `RevocationList`, `PolicyRules`, `PublicKey`, `PrivateKey`, and `Proof` to represent the data being used in the ZKP protocols.
5.  **Add error handling and security considerations** throughout the implementation.

This outline provides a strong foundation for building a more complete and advanced ZKP library in Go, showcasing its potential for real-world applications in secure and privacy-preserving systems.
