Okay, here is a Golang implementation focusing on the *structure* and *concepts* of a Zero-Knowledge Proof system applied to a specific, somewhat advanced data privacy scenario: Proving properties about a private dataset without revealing the data.

This example focuses on:
1.  Proving knowledge of a set of records.
2.  Proving the sum of a specific field across those records is correct.
3.  Conceptualizing (with simplified implementation) proving that a field within each record meets a range constraint (e.g., is non-negative).

It *does not* implement a full-blown production-ready ZKP scheme (like Groth16, PLONK, etc.) from scratch, as that would be duplicating complex open-source libraries and is prohibitively complex and error-prone for this format. Instead, it builds a *system structure* around basic cryptographic primitives (hashing) and simplified ZKP concepts (commitment-challenge-response, knowledge proofs) applied to the data scenario.

	//
	// *Alternative Simplified Range Check Idea:* What if the Prover committed to the Amount *explicitly*
	// in the `RangeAuxiliary` (not H(Amount || rand), but a commitment *to* Amount using a hiding commitment)
	// and provided auxiliary proofs allowing the Verifier to confirm Amount >= Min and <= Max.
	// This is still complex.
	//

	// Since we don't, this verification function can only be illustrative.
	// A common pattern in range proofs is proving knowledge of `Amount` and `RangeRandomness`

	// 1. Verify the set commitment proof part
	// The committed value for the set commitment is H(combined_record_hashes).
	// The verifier needs to know this value *publicly* or derive it from public info.
	// In this scenario, the *public* info is the `PublicSetCommitment`.
	// The prover committed to H(H(all_record_hashes) || SetRandomness).
	// The response is SetRandomness + challenge * H(all_record_hashes).
	// The verifier needs H(all_record_hashes) to verify this.
	// This implies that H(all_record_hashes) might need to be derived from the initial
	// `proof.InitialCommitments.SetCommitment` in a complex way, or that the verifier
	// receives some public derivation value.
	//
	// Let's rethink the SetCommitment proof.
	// Prover commits to: SetCommitment = H(H(all_record_hashes) || SetRandomness).
	// Prover proves knowledge of H(all_record_hashes) and SetRandomness.
	// The verifier knows the *expected* SetCommitment (`v.PublicSetCommitment`).
	// Check: VerifyKnowledgeProofPart({SetCommitment, SetResponse}, challenge, H(all_record_hashes)).
	// Verifier *doesn't know* H(all_record_hashes).
	//
	// A standard approach: Prover commits to random value V_set. Prover proves knowledge of SetRandomness
	// such that CommitSet = H(V_set || SetRandomness) AND V_set = H(all_record_hashes).
	// The proof for V_set = H(all_record_hashes) is complex (an arithmetic circuit).
	//
	// Let's simplify the SetProof: Prover commits to SetCommitment = H(SetRandomness).
	// Prover provides SetResponse = SetRandomness + challenge * H(all_record_hashes).
	// Verifier receives SetCommitment, SetResponse. Verifier computes challenge.
	// Verifier needs H(all_record_hashes) to check H(SetResponse - challenge * H(all_record_hashes)) == H(SetRandomness) == SetCommitment.
	// The verifier *still* needs H(all_record_hashes). This value MUST be derivable from public info or proven separately.
	//
	// Assuming H(all_record_hashes) is somehow verifiable implicitly through other proofs (like record proofs),
	// OR assuming the SetCommitment *itself* implies H(all_record_hashes) publicly (e.g., if SetCommitment was H(H(all_record_hashes))),
	// the current structure won't work as a *knowledge proof* for the combined hash.
	//
	// Let's revert the SetCommitment to a simple hash of concatenated record hashes, and prove knowledge of the *individual record data*
	// which implies knowledge of their hashes and thus the combined hash. The `SetResponse` and `SetCommitmentRandomness`
	// can be used in a different kind of structural check, or removed if individual record proofs suffice for this part.
	//
	// Rework SetCommitment part:
	// Public: PublicSetCommitment = H(H(R1) || H(R2) || ...) derived from records.
	// Prover commits: RecordCommitment_i = H(HashRecord(Ri) || RecordRandomness_i).
	// Prover proves knowledge of HashRecord(Ri) and RecordRandomness_i for each i.
	// Verifier checks this for each record commitment provided.
	// The SetCommitment proof can then verify that the *hashes* implicitly proven match the public set commitment.

	// Let's adjust the verification flow based on this:
	// 1. Verify each individual RecordKnowledgeProof. This proves knowledge of HashRecord(Ri) and RecordRandomness_i.
	// 2. From the verified RecordKnowledgeProofs, the Verifier can conceptually recover the HashRecord(Ri) values.
	//    This is NOT true in a real ZKP (you only prove knowledge, not reveal).
	//    In a real ZKP, the connection between individual commitments and the set commitment
	//    would be verified via a circuit or protocol specific to aggregate/set commitments (like Merkle proofs against a root).
	//
	// Let's use the provided SetCommitment and SetResponse for a structural check related to the *aggregate* of the individual record hashes, acknowledging its simplification.

	// Re-calculate H(all_record_hashes) from the individual record knowledge proofs' implied values?
	// No, that reveals the values. The verification must be done without revealing them.
	//
	// The SetCommitment in `proof.InitialCommitments` was computed using Prover's `SetCommitmentRandomness`.
	// The Verifier knows the *expected* public set commitment `v.PublicSetCommitment`,
	// which was computed differently (e.g., H(H(R1)||...)) and doesn't involve `SetCommitmentRandomness`.
	//
	// Let's assume `proof.InitialCommitments.SetCommitment` IS the H(SetRandomness) commitment,
	// and `proof.SetResponse` IS `SetRandomness + challenge * H(all_record_hashes)`.
	// The verifier needs H(all_record_hashes) to verify this. This value is private!
	//
	// This specific SetCommitment proof structure as a simple knowledge proof over
	// H(all_record_hashes) is flawed for privacy.
	//
	// A better approach for set commitment: Prover commits to each record. Prover generates Merkle root of these commitments. Prover proves knowledge of commitment for Ri and path to root. The Merkle root is the public SetCommitment.
	// The current structure uses Commitments map for individual records and a single SetCommitment hash.
	// Let's use the SetCommitment verification to check consistency *between* the aggregate hash derived from verified record knowledge proofs and the SetCommitment provided. Still requires deriving the aggregate hash though.
	//
	// *Final simplified approach for Set Commitment Verification:*
	// The `proof.InitialCommitments.SetCommitment` is H(H(all_record_hashes) || SetRandomness).
	// The `proof.SetResponse` is SetRandomness + challenge * H(all_record_hashes).
	// The Verifier can check if `CommitToValue(H(all_record_hashes), SetResponse - challenge * H(all_record_hashes))` equals `proof.InitialCommitments.SetCommitment`.
	// PROBLEM: Verifier still doesn't know H(all_record_hashes).
	//
	// Let's assume the SetCommitment verification *is implicitly covered* by verifying all individual record commitments and knowing that these records *must* form the set related to the public SetCommitment. This is a common pattern in ZK-Rollups (proving inclusion in a state root).
	//
	// So, verification steps:
	// 1. Verify each individual RecordKnowledgeProof. (Verifies knowledge of HashRecord(Ri) and randomness used).
	//    Crucially, this check uses `VerifyKnowledgeProofPart`, which requires the committed value (HashRecord(Ri)). This value is private!
	//    The verification must check if `proof.RecordKnowledgeProofs[id].Commitment` equals `CommitToValue(HashRecord(Ri), randomness_i)`
	//    and `proof.RecordKnowledgeProofs[id].Response` equals `randomness_i + challenge * HashRecord(Ri)`.
	//    The Verifier does NOT know `HashRecord(Ri)` or `randomness_i`.
	//    The `VerifyKnowledgeProofPart` helper must be used correctly: It verifies if `Commitment == H(Value || (Response - challenge * Value))`. It needs `Value` as input.
	//    This means the *committed value* (HashRecord(Ri)) somehow needs to be input to the verification, which contradicts ZK.
	//
	// RETHINK Verification Helper: `VerifyKnowledgeProofPart` takes the *committed value* as an argument.
	// This is only possible if the committed value is PUBLIC.
	// In our scenario, HashRecord(Ri) and TotalAmount are PRIVATE secrets.
	//
	// This highlights a fundamental misunderstanding in the simplified approach: Schnorr-like proofs prove knowledge of a *secret* that is part of a *public* value (e.g., proving knowledge of `x` such that `y = g^x` where `y` is public).
	// Here, we are trying to prove knowledge of `RecordData` or `TotalAmount` which are secret, related to *commitments* which are public.
	// Commitment = H(SecretValue || Randomness). Proving knowledge of SecretValue and Randomness.
	// A ZKP for this pattern is usually done by:
	// Prover commits to random V = H(v_val || v_rand).
	// Verifier challenges c.
	// Prover responds z_val = v_val + c * SecretValue, z_rand = v_rand + c * Randomness.
	// Verifier checks Commit == H( (z_val - c * SecretValue) || (z_rand - c * Randomness) ).
	// STILL needs SecretValue.
	//
	// The standard ZKP approach requires representing the claim (e.g., "I know RecordData Ri such that H(Ri)=hash AND sum(Amounts)=Total") as an ARITHMETIC CIRCUIT. The ZKP system proves the circuit is satisfied on secret inputs.
	//
	// Given the constraint of NOT duplicating complex libraries and staying basic, we *cannot* implement a cryptographically sound proof for this private data scenario using only hash commitments and simple big.Int arithmetic in a Schnorr-like structure.
	//
	// Let's adjust the verification steps to be *conceptual* checks based on the *intended* logic of the proof parts, while acknowledging the cryptographic gap. The `VerifyKnowledgeProofPart` will check the structure, but its application here against *private* values is flawed in reality.

	// --- CONCEPTUAL VERIFICATION ---

	// 1. Verify individual Record Knowledge Proofs:
	// Conceptually, for each record ID 'id' in the proof:
	// Verify that `proof.RecordKnowledgeProofs[id]` proves knowledge of `HashRecord(SecretRecord_id)`
	// using the commitment `proof.InitialCommitments.RecordCommitments[id]` and challenge `v.Challenge`.
	// We cannot perform this check without the secret `HashRecord(SecretRecord_id)`.
	// Let's skip this check directly and assume the overall Set Commitment check (if implemented) or other proofs would implicitly cover this.
	// This step is fundamental but impossible with the chosen simple primitives for private values.
	// We will instead check the *consistency* of the provided proof parts.

	// 2. Verify consistency between individual record commitments and the *public* Set Commitment.
	// The public Set Commitment is `v.PublicSetCommitment`.
	// The prover's commitments are in `proof.InitialCommitments.RecordCommitments`.
	// Check if `v.PublicSetCommitment` == `CalculateSetCommitment(conceptual_records, conceptual_set_randomness)`.
	// We don't have the records or the randomness.
	//
	// Let's adjust the *meaning* of `v.PublicSetCommitment`. Assume it is H(H(R1) || ... || H(Rn)).
	// And `proof.InitialCommitments.SetCommitment` is H(SetRandomness).
	// And `proof.SetResponse` is SetRandomness + challenge * H(H(R1) || ... || H(Rn)).
	// The verifier *knows* H(H(R1) || ... || H(Rn)) == v.PublicSetCommitment.
	// So the verifier can check if `CommitToValue(v.PublicSetCommitment, proof.SetResponse - challenge * v.PublicSetCommitment)` == `proof.InitialCommitments.SetCommitment`.
	// This requires treating hash bytes as big.Ints for arithmetic again, which is unsound but fits the illustrative model.

	// 1. Verify Set Commitment Proof (using the public SetCommitment as the 'value' known by Verifier)
	// Prover committed H(SetRandomness) as `proof.InitialCommitments.SetCommitment`.
	// Prover response is SetRandomness + challenge * v.PublicSetCommitment.
	// Verifier checks H(SetResponse - challenge * v.PublicSetCommitment) == Initial Set Commitment.
	// This proves knowledge of SetRandomness AND that a value *equal to* v.PublicSetCommitment was used in the response calculation.
	setCommittedValueBytes := v.PublicSetCommitment // The value whose relation to randomness is proven
	setKnowledgeProofCheck := ProofPartKnowledge{
		Commitment: proof.InitialCommitments.SetCommitment,
		Response: proof.SetResponse,
	}
	if !VerifyKnowledgeProofPart(setKnowledgeProofCheck, v.Challenge, setCommittedValueBytes) {
		fmt.Println("Set commitment proof failed.")
		return false, errors.New("set commitment proof verification failed")
	}
	fmt.Println("Set commitment proof verified structurally.")

	// 2. Verify Sum Proof Part
	// Prover committed H(TotalAmount || SumRandomness) as `proof.InitialCommitments.SumCommitment`.
	// Prover response is SumRandomness + challenge * TotalAmount.
	// Verifier knows PublicTotalAmount.
	// Check H(SumResponse - challenge * PublicTotalAmount) == Initial Sum Commitment.
	// This proves knowledge of SumRandomness AND that a value *equal to* PublicTotalAmount was used.
	sumCommittedValueBytes := BigIntToBytes(v.PublicTotalAmount)
	sumKnowledgeProofCheck := ProofPartKnowledge{
		Commitment: proof.InitialCommitments.SumCommitment,
		Response: proof.SumProof.SumResponse,
	}
	if !VerifyKnowledgeProofPart(sumKnowledgeProofCheck, v.Challenge, sumCommittedValueBytes) {
		fmt.Println("Sum commitment proof failed.")
		return false, errors.New("sum commitment proof verification failed")
	}
	fmt.Println("Sum commitment proof verified structurally.")

	// 3. Verify Range Proof Part (Simplified as discussed above)
	// This checks structural consistency and the simplified placeholder check.
	if !VerifyRangeProofPart(proof.RangeProof, v.Challenge, proof.InitialCommitments.RecordCommitments, v.AmountMin, v.AmountMax) {
		fmt.Println("Range proof part failed.")
		return false, errors.New("range proof verification failed")
	}
	fmt.Println("Range proof part verified structurally (simplified check).")


	// 4. Consistency Check: Do the *individual record commitments* match those used to compute the *public set commitment*?
	// This is the trickiest part with simple primitives. In a real ZKP, individual record commitments
	// (or proofs about them) would be aggregated cryptographically (e.g., Merkle tree).
	// Here, we only have the *proofs of knowledge* for individual record commitments, but not the actual commitments themselves revealed, nor a structure linking them to the public set commitment without revealing info.
	//
	// Let's assume the verifier, having verified the SetCommitment (step 1), is satisfied that the *set of hashes*
	// corresponds to the public set commitment, and by verifying the SumProof (step 2), is satisfied that the sum
	// corresponds to the public total.
	// The individual `RecordKnowledgeProofs` provided in the proof are then checked for structural integrity.
	// They prove knowledge of `HashRecord(Ri)` and `RecordRandomness_i` used in `proof.InitialCommitments.RecordCommitments[id]`.
	// The verifier needs to check:
	// `VerifyKnowledgeProofPart(ProofPartKnowledge, challenge, HashRecord(Ri))` against `proof.InitialCommitments.RecordCommitments[id]`.
	// Again, needs `HashRecord(Ri)`, which is private.

	// A more realistic check within the illustrative framework: Check if the *committed individual record hashes*
	// implied by the verified SetCommitment proof are consistent with the *committed individual record hashes* implied
	// by the individual RecordKnowledgeProofs. This still requires recovering/implying the private HashRecord(Ri) values.

	// Let's proceed by checking the *structure* of each individual record proof, assuming (unsoundly) that
	// `VerifyKnowledgeProofPart` could somehow work with the private `HashRecord(Ri)` values.
	// In reality, the verifier would check that the commitment `proof.InitialCommitments.RecordCommitments[id]`
	// was correctly formed in the first place (e.g., included in a Merkle tree whose root is public).
	// And the `ProofPartKnowledge` would likely prove properties *about* the committed value (HashRecord(Ri))
	// without revealing it.

	// --- CONCEPTUAL CHECK OF INDIVIDUAL RECORD PROOFS ---
	// This step is illustrative of *where* individual record verification would happen,
	// but the actual `VerifyKnowledgeProofPart` call here against a secret value is not feasible
	// in a real ZKP with these primitives.
	// We iterate through the commitments provided by the prover and check if a corresponding knowledge proof exists.
	for id, commitment := range proof.InitialCommitments.RecordCommitments {
		kp, ok := proof.RecordKnowledgeProofs[id]
		if !ok {
			fmt.Printf("Missing knowledge proof for record %s\n", id)
			return false, errors.New("missing knowledge proof for a committed record")
		}
		// Check if the commitment in the proof part matches the initial commitment provided
		if !bytes.Equal(kp.Commitment, commitment) {
			fmt.Printf("Commitment mismatch for record %s\n", id)
			return false, errors.New("commitment mismatch in knowledge proof")
		}

		// CONCEPTUAL CHECK: If VerifyKnowledgeProofPart could somehow take a private value
		// and verify against its commitment/response. This cannot be done with simple hashing.
		// For illustration, we call it, knowing it needs the secret value as input.
		// A real ZKP would verify a circuit relation here.
		// if !VerifyKnowledgeProofPart(kp, v.Challenge, conceptual_HashRecord_Ri) {
		//    fmt.Printf("Individual record knowledge proof failed for %s\n", id)
		//    return false, errors.New("individual record knowledge proof failed")
		// }
	}
	fmt.Println("Individual record knowledge proofs verified structurally (conceptual check).")

	// If all checks pass (structural and the simplified logic), the proof is considered valid *within this illustrative framework*.
	fmt.Println("All proof parts verified (within simplified model).")
	return true, nil
