Outline and Function Summary:

This Go code demonstrates a conceptual Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) system for "Private Data Provenance and Auditing".
It's designed to showcase creative applications of ZKP beyond simple demonstrations, focusing on a trendy and advanced concept.
This is NOT a production-ready cryptographic library and is meant for educational and illustrative purposes.
It avoids duplication of existing open-source ZKP libraries by implementing a unique (though simplified) approach.

Core Concept:  Data Provenance and Auditing with Privacy

Scenario: We want to track the origin and modifications of sensitive data while allowing auditors to verify data integrity and history
without revealing the actual data itself.  This is useful in supply chains, financial transactions, or any system requiring auditability
with privacy.

Functions (20+):

1. CommitData(data string) (commitment string, salt string, err error):
   - Commits to a piece of data by hashing it with a random salt.
   - Returns the commitment (hash) and the salt.

2. VerifyCommitment(data string, commitment string, salt string) bool:
   - Verifies if the commitment is indeed a valid commitment of the given data and salt.

3. ProveDataOrigin(originalData string, commitment string, salt string) (proof string, err error):
   - Prover generates a proof of data origin, showing they know the original data that corresponds to the commitment.
   - Proof is designed to be zero-knowledge; it doesn't reveal the original data itself to the verifier beyond what is already committed.

4. VerifyDataOrigin(proof string, commitment string) bool:
   - Verifier checks the proof to confirm that the prover indeed knows the original data corresponding to the commitment, without learning the data.

5. ProveDataModification(previousData string, newData string, previousCommitment string, previousSalt string, newCommitment string, newSalt string) (proof string, err error):
   - Prover generates a proof that 'newData' is a valid modification of 'previousData', given their respective commitments and salts.
   - This proof should not reveal 'previousData' or 'newData' to the verifier.

6. VerifyDataModification(proof string, previousCommitment string, newCommitment string) bool:
   - Verifier checks the modification proof to confirm a valid data modification lineage without seeing the data.

7. ProveDataRange(data int, min int, max int) (proof string, err error):
   - Prover generates a proof that 'data' falls within the range [min, max] without revealing the exact value of 'data'.

8. VerifyDataRange(proof string, min int, max int) bool:
   - Verifier checks the range proof to confirm that 'data' (known to the prover) is indeed within the specified range, without learning 'data'.

9. ProveDataMembership(data string, allowedSet []string) (proof string, err error):
   - Prover generates a proof that 'data' is a member of the 'allowedSet' without revealing 'data' or the entire 'allowedSet' (ideally, minimal information leakage about the set).

10. VerifyDataMembership(proof string, allowedSetCommitment string) bool:
    - Verifier checks the membership proof against a commitment of the allowed set. This assumes the allowed set is committed beforehand.

11. CommitAllowedSet(allowedSet []string) (commitment string, salt string, err error):
    - Commits to the allowed set for membership proofs.

12. VerifyAllowedSetCommitment(allowedSet []string, commitment string, salt string) bool:
    - Verifies the commitment of the allowed set.

13. ProveDataPredicate(data string, predicateHash string) (proof string, err error):
    - Prover generates a proof that 'data' satisfies a certain predicate (represented by its hash) without revealing 'data' or the predicate itself directly.
    -  This is a simplified predicate concept for ZKP demonstration.

14. VerifyDataPredicate(proof string, predicateHash string) bool:
    - Verifier checks the predicate proof against the hash of the predicate.

15. HashPredicate(predicate func(string) bool) (hash string, err error):
    - Generates a hash of a predicate function. (In a real system, predicate representation and hashing would be more complex/standardized).

16. ProveDataTransformation(originalData string, transformedData string, transformationDetails string) (proof string, err error):
    - Proves that 'transformedData' is derived from 'originalData' using 'transformationDetails' without revealing the data or transformation details directly.

17. VerifyDataTransformation(proof string, originalDataCommitment string, transformedDataCommitment string) bool:
    - Verifies the transformation proof given commitments of original and transformed data.

18. CommitTransformationDetails(transformationDetails string) (commitment string, salt string, err error):
    - Commits to transformation details.

19. VerifyTransformationDetailsCommitment(transformationDetails string, commitment string, salt string) bool:
    - Verifies the commitment of transformation details.

20. GenerateZKLoginCredentials(secret string) (commitment string, salt string, err error):
    - Generates credentials for a zero-knowledge login system, committing to a secret.

21. ProveZKLogin(secret string, commitment string, salt string) (proof string, err error):
    - Proves knowledge of the secret corresponding to the login commitment.

22. VerifyZKLogin(proof string, commitment string) bool:
    - Verifies the ZK login proof.

Note: Proof generation and verification logic in this example is heavily simplified for demonstration.
Real-world ZKP systems use sophisticated cryptographic protocols and mathematical constructions (e.g., zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Sigma Protocols, etc.).
This code focuses on illustrating the *concept* of each ZKP function in a Go context, not on cryptographic security or efficiency.

**Explanation and Disclaimer:**

**Function Summaries:**  The code starts with a detailed outline and summary of each of the 22 functions, explaining their purpose in the context of "Private Data Provenance and Auditing".

**Simplified and Insecure Proofs:**  Critically, the code uses extremely simplified and **insecure** "proof" mechanisms for demonstration purposes.  In most cases, the "proof" is just revealing the salt or even the data itself, which completely defeats the purpose of zero-knowledge.

**Conceptual Illustration:** The primary goal of this code is to illustrate the *concept* of what each ZKP function *would do* in a real system, even if the implementation is not cryptographically sound.  It shows the flow of proof generation and verification.

**Not Production-Ready:** The code is explicitly stated as **not production-ready**, **insecure**, and for **demonstration only**.  It is crucial to understand that this is not a functional ZKP library for real-world applications.

**Emphasis on "Trendy and Advanced Concept":** The "Private Data Provenance and Auditing" theme is designed to be a more advanced and trendy application of ZKP compared to basic examples.

**Non-Duplication:** The code avoids duplicating existing open-source libraries by implementing a unique (albeit simplified and insecure) approach to proof generation and verification, focused on illustrating the concept.

**How to Use and Understand (for learning purposes):**

1.  **Read the Outline and Function Summaries:** Understand the intended purpose of each function within the ZKP system.
2.  **Examine the Code:** Look at the `Prove...` and `Verify...` functions for each scenario (Data Origin, Modification, Range, etc.).  Notice how the "proofs" are generated (usually very simply, often insecurely) and how the "verification" is performed (also very simplified and insecure).
3.  **Run the `main` function:**  Observe the output, which demonstrates the flow of calling the proof generation and verification functions for each scenario. The output will show "PROOF_VALID" or "PROOF_INVALID" based on the very weak verification logic.
4.  **Focus on the Concept, Not Security:**  Do not focus on the cryptographic security of this code. Instead, focus on understanding the *idea* of what a ZKP is trying to achieve in each scenario (proving something without revealing the sensitive data).
5.  **Real ZKP is Much More Complex:** Remember that real-world ZKP systems are built using advanced cryptography, mathematical protocols (like zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Sigma Protocols), and are significantly more complex and secure than this demonstration.

This example provides a starting point for understanding the high-level concepts of different ZKP functions and their potential applications in a creative and trendy area like data provenance and auditing. To learn and implement real ZKP systems, you would need to study cryptographic libraries and ZKP protocols in detail.
