Outline and Function Summary:

Package Name: zkproof

Package Summary:
This package provides a collection of advanced and creative Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) functionalities in Golang, going beyond basic demonstrations and avoiding duplication of existing open-source implementations. It focuses on building a conceptual framework for various ZKP applications, particularly in decentralized systems, privacy-preserving computations, and secure credential management. The functions explore diverse ZKP techniques and aim to showcase the potential of ZKP in modern, trendy applications.

Function List (20+ Functions):

1.  SetupParams(): Generates global parameters for the ZKP system, including cryptographic groups and generators.
2.  GenerateKeyPair(): Creates a public and private key pair for a Prover or Verifier.
3.  CommitToValue(value, randomness): Prover commits to a secret value using a commitment scheme (e.g., Pedersen commitment).
4.  OpenCommitment(commitment, value, randomness): Prover reveals the committed value and randomness to allow verification.
5.  VerifyCommitment(commitment, value, randomness): Verifier checks if the commitment is valid for the given value and randomness.
6.  ProveRange(value, min, max, privateKey): Prover generates a ZKP that a value is within a specified range without revealing the value itself (e.g., using Bulletproofs or similar range proof techniques - outline, not full implementation).
7.  VerifyRangeProof(proof, publicKey, min, max): Verifier checks the validity of the range proof.
8.  ProveMembership(value, set, privateKey): Prover generates a ZKP that a value belongs to a specific set without revealing the value or the entire set (e.g., using Merkle Tree based ZKP - outline).
9.  VerifyMembershipProof(proof, publicKey, setIdentifier): Verifier checks the validity of the membership proof against a set identifier.
10. ProveNonMembership(value, set, privateKey): Prover generates a ZKP that a value *does not* belong to a set without revealing the value or the entire set (outline - challenging, could use techniques related to set difference proofs).
11. VerifyNonMembershipProof(proof, publicKey, setIdentifier): Verifier checks the validity of the non-membership proof.
12. ProveEquality(value1, value2, privateKey): Prover generates a ZKP that two commitments or encrypted values are derived from the same underlying value without revealing the value itself (e.g., using sigma protocols for equality).
13. VerifyEqualityProof(proof, commitment1, commitment2, publicKey): Verifier checks the validity of the equality proof.
14. ProveInequality(value1, value2, privateKey): Prover generates a ZKP that two commitments or encrypted values are NOT derived from the same underlying value without revealing the values themselves (outline - more complex equality negation).
15. VerifyInequalityProof(proof, commitment1, commitment2, publicKey): Verifier checks the validity of the inequality proof.
16. ProveKnowledgeOfPreimage(hashValue, preimage, privateKey): Prover proves knowledge of a preimage for a given hash value without revealing the preimage itself.
17. VerifyKnowledgeOfPreimageProof(proof, hashValue, publicKey): Verifier checks the validity of the knowledge of preimage proof.
18. ProveConditionalStatement(condition, privateInputForCondition, output, function, privateKey): Prover proves that a certain condition holds true based on private input, and if it holds, a publicly verifiable output is produced, all without revealing the private input or intermediate steps (outline - think of ZK smart contracts or conditional disclosure).
19. VerifyConditionalStatementProof(proof, output, function, publicKey): Verifier checks the proof for the conditional statement and the correctness of the output if the condition was supposed to be met.
20. ProveAuthenticatedData(data, signature, publicKeyOfSigner, privateKey): Prover proves that a piece of data is authentically signed by a known entity without revealing the signer's private key again (re-using existing signature but in ZKP context).
21. VerifyAuthenticatedDataProof(proof, data, publicKeyOfSigner): Verifier checks the proof of authenticated data.
22. ProveAttributeCompliance(attributeName, attributeValue, policy, privateKey): Prover proves that a specific attribute value complies with a given policy (e.g., age is > 18) without revealing the exact attribute value (outline - policy-based ZKP).
23. VerifyAttributeComplianceProof(proof, attributeName, policy, publicKey): Verifier checks the attribute compliance proof against the policy.
24. ProveAggregateKnowledge(proofsList, logicalOperation, publicKey): Prover combines multiple ZKP proofs and uses logical operations (AND, OR, NOT) to create a composite proof about multiple statements (outline - proof aggregation and composition).
25. VerifyAggregateKnowledgeProof(aggregateProof, logicalOperation, publicKey): Verifier checks the validity of the aggregate proof.

Note: This is an outline with function summaries.  Full implementation of all these functions, especially the "advanced" ones like range proofs, membership proofs, non-membership proofs, conditional statements, and aggregate proofs, would require significant cryptographic library usage and potentially complex algorithm implementations (e.g., using libraries like `go-ethereum/crypto/bn256`, `kyber`, or implementing protocols from cryptographic research papers). This example focuses on showcasing the breadth of ZKP applications and providing a conceptual structure in Go.  The functions are designed to be more than just basic demonstrations and explore creative and trendy uses of ZKP.
