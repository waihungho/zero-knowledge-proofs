Outline and Function Summary:

Package: zkp_voting

Summary:
This package implements a zero-knowledge proof system for a simplified, yet conceptually advanced, private voting system. It showcases how ZKP can be used to ensure voter eligibility, vote validity, and tally correctness without revealing individual votes or voter identities.  This is not a production-ready system but a demonstration of ZKP principles in a creative and trendy application.

Functions (20+):

Setup and Initialization:
1.  GenerateElectionParameters(): Generates public parameters for the election, including cryptographic keys and voting options.
2.  InitializeVoterRegistry(): Creates an empty voter registry, potentially using a secure data structure.
3.  RegisterVoter(voterID, proofOfIdentity): Registers a voter with the system after verifying a zero-knowledge proof of identity.
4.  SetupTallyingMechanism(): Initializes the secure tallying mechanism, possibly using homomorphic encryption or secure multi-party computation concepts (simulated).

Voter Actions:
5.  GetVotingOptions(): Retrieves the available voting options for the current election.
6.  CreateVote(voterID, voteChoice): Creates a vote object for a voter, ensuring the vote is valid against the allowed options.
7.  GenerateEligibilityProof(voterID, electionParameters, voterCredentials): Generates a zero-knowledge proof that the voter is eligible to vote without revealing their identity.  (Conceptual ZKP - simplified for demonstration)
8.  GenerateVoteValidityProof(vote, electionParameters): Generates a zero-knowledge proof that the vote is valid and belongs to the allowed options, without revealing the vote choice itself. (Conceptual ZKP - simplified for demonstration)
9.  SubmitVote(vote, eligibilityProof, validityProof): Submits the vote along with the eligibility and validity proofs to the election authority.
10. VerifyRegistrationStatus(voterID, proofOfRegistration): Allows a voter to anonymously check their registration status using a ZKP.

Election Authority Actions:
11. VerifyEligibilityProof(eligibilityProof, electionParameters): Verifies the zero-knowledge proof of voter eligibility.
12. VerifyVoteValidityProof(validityProof, electionParameters): Verifies the zero-knowledge proof of vote validity.
13. RecordEncryptedVote(encryptedVote, eligibilityProof, validityProof): Records the encrypted vote if both eligibility and validity proofs are valid.
14. StartTallyingProcess(): Initiates the secure tallying process after the voting period ends.
15. AggregateEncryptedVotes(): Aggregates the encrypted votes in a privacy-preserving manner (simulated homomorphic addition).
16. DecryptTallyResult(aggregatedVotes, decryptionKey): Decrypts the aggregated votes to get the final tally (using a simulated decryption key).
17. PublishElectionResults(tallyResult, publicVerificationData): Publishes the election results along with data that allows public verification of the tally (e.g., ZKP of tally correctness - conceptual).
18. AuditVote(voteID, decryptionKey): Allows an auditor to decrypt and inspect a specific vote (for auditing purposes, with proper authorization and logging - not strictly ZKP but related to transparency).
19. GenerateTallyCorrectnessProof(encryptedVotes, tallyResult, publicParameters): Generates a zero-knowledge proof that the published tally is correct based on the encrypted votes, without revealing individual votes. (Advanced conceptual ZKP)
20. VerifyTallyCorrectnessProof(tallyCorrectnessProof, publicParameters, publishedTally): Verifies the zero-knowledge proof of tally correctness.
21. RevokeVoterRegistration(voterID, adminCredentials, revocationProof): Revokes a voter's registration using administrative credentials and a proof of authorization. (Admin function, not ZKP core but related to system management).


Note: This is a conceptual implementation. True zero-knowledge proofs require complex cryptographic constructions. This code will simulate the logic and flow of a ZKP system without implementing actual cryptographic ZKP algorithms for simplicity and demonstration purposes within the scope of the request.  For a real-world ZKP system, established cryptographic libraries and protocols would be necessary.
