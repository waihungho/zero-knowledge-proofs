Okay, let's design a conceptual Zero-Knowledge Proof framework in Go. Given the constraint to *not* duplicate existing open-source libraries and focus on *advanced concepts* with at least 20 functions, we cannot build a full, production-grade SNARK or STARK from scratch here (that's years of work). Instead, we will build a framework based on polynomial commitments and proving polynomial identities, which is a core concept in many modern ZKPs (like Plonk, Marlin, etc.).

We'll focus on proving knowledge of a witness `w` such that a public polynomial relation `P(x, public_inputs) = 0` holds when evaluated at `x=w`. The 'advanced concept' here is using polynomial evaluation and identity testing over a finite field as the basis for the proof, and showing how statements like set membership or arithmetic can be encoded into such polynomial relations.

This implementation will be conceptual and simplified, *not* production-ready. It will use basic finite field arithmetic and a conceptual polynomial commitment scheme (e.g., based on hashing coefficients or evaluations, which is *not* cryptographically secure for polynomial identity testing in a real ZKP, but serves to illustrate the concept without implementing complex primitives like pairings or FRI).

	// and Witness.SecretValue is the root 'w' being proven.
	// Example: Statement might imply P(x) = (x - public_data[0]) * (x - public_data[1]) - Witness.Auxiliary[0]
	// and we prove P(witness.SecretValue) = 0. This is complex.
	// A simpler approach for this framework: Assume the statement implies P(x) is some structure,
	// and we prove P(witness.SecretValue) = 0.
	// We need a concrete P(x) based on the witness and public inputs.
	// Let's assume the polynomial `P(x)` *is* constructed by the caller and passed in,
	// representing the relation `P(x)=0` that the witness `w` satisfies.
	// So, the PROVER constructs P(x) which uses their secret witness implicitly or explicitly.

	// If proving w^2 = public_y, Prover implicitly constructs the relation w^2 - public_y = 0.
	// How is P(x) defined based on witness and public?
	// Let's say we are proving a relation of the form `R(witness, public_inputs) = 0`.
	// We encode this into a polynomial `P(x)` such that `P(witness) = R(witness, public_inputs)`.
	// So, the Prover constructs P(x) which *already* incorporates the witness value implicitly or is defined such that evaluating at the witness value gives the desired result (usually 0).

	// *** Simplified Approach for this framework: ***
	// The statement implies a target value `target_val` (usually 0).
	// The prover constructs a polynomial P(x) such that P(witness.SecretValue) = target_val.
	// The verifier will know how to reconstruct a *related* polynomial or check properties of P(x) based on public info.
	// Let's assume Statement and PublicInput implicitly define the polynomial P(x) the prover will use.
	// Example: Prove knowledge of w such that w is a root of S(x). The prover uses P(x) = S(x).
	// Prover computes P(w) which should be 0.
	// The challenge `z` from Fiat-Shamir will be used to prove the polynomial identity.

	// For this framework, let's simplify further: We are proving knowledge of `w` such that `P(w) = target_value` (usually 0).
	// The prover computes the polynomial P(x) such that P(w) == target_value.
	// The verifier *cannot* compute P(x) because it depends on `w`.
	// The verifier checks the polynomial identity P(x) - P(z) = (x-z) * Q(x) for a random challenge `z`.

	// Let's define a conceptual Statement function that yields the polynomial P(x) *for the prover*.
	// This P(x) *will* depend on the witness.
	// This is a major simplification. In a real ZKP, the polynomial encoding is more structured (e.g., R1CS to QAP).

	// --- Step 1: Prover constructs P(x) based on statement and witness ---
	// This is the most application-specific part. Let's make it concrete for the example wrappers later.
	// For now, assume a function exists: `ConstructProverPolynomial(statement, witness)`.
	// Since this function isn't defined generically, let's assume P(x) is calculated elsewhere and passed in,
	// or ProveKnowledgeOfPolyRelation is called by wrappers like ProveSetMembershipPoly.
	// Let's refactor: The *wrapper* functions will construct P(x) and call a core proving helper.

	// --- Refactored Core Proving Helper (Internal) ---
	// This internal helper takes the specific P(x) constructed by the caller (wrapper function).
	// It proves knowledge of 'w' implicitly by proving P(w) = target_value (implicitly 0).

	// Since our Commitment is just a hash of coefficients, we CANNOT do this check cryptographically.
	// Our `VerifyCommitment` only checks if a given polynomial matches the hash, which the verifier *cannot* compute for P or Q.

	// *** Conceptual Verification Step (Simulated) ***
	// In a real system, the verifier would perform checks like:
	// PCS.VerifyCommitment(verificationKey, proof.CommitmentP) // Check if Comm(P) is a valid commitment
	// PCS.VerifyCommitment(verificationKey, proof.CommitmentQ) // Check if Comm(Q) is a valid commitment
	// PCS.VerifyEvaluation(verificationKey, proof.CommitmentP, proof.Challenge, proof.EvaluationAtChallenge, proof.OpeningProofForP_at_Z) // Verify P(z) = EvaluationAtChallenge
	// PCS.VerifyDivisionIdentity(verificationKey, proof.CommitmentP, proof.CommitmentQ, proof.EvaluationAtChallenge, proof.Challenge) // Verify Comm(P) - Comm(P(z)) == Comm(x-z) * Comm(Q)
	// where Comm(P(z)) is a commitment to the constant polynomial P(z), and Comm(x-z) is a commitment to the linear polynomial (x-z).

	// Since we lack a real PCS, our verification check is limited.
	// We can only conceptually state what should be verified.
	// A hash commitment doesn't allow verifying properties *of* the polynomial without knowing the polynomial itself.

	// *** Simplified Verification Logic (based on the weak hash commitment) ***
	// With the current conceptual hash commitment (hashing coefficients), the verifier cannot
	// verify P(x) or Q(x) from the commitments without the polynomials.
	// The only check possible with this weak commitment is: if the verifier *could* reconstruct P(x) (which they can't),
	// they would check if hashing it gives CommP, and same for Q.
	// The check P(x) - P(z) = (x-z) * Q(x) cannot be done via hash of coefficients.

	// Let's redefine what our simplified proof verifies slightly for this framework:
	// The proof proves knowledge of P(x) such that P(w) = targetValue, by providing Comm(P) and Comm(Q)
	// where Q = (P(x) - P(w)) / (x-w), and an evaluation P(w) (which is targetValue).
	// The challenge 'z' is not used for P(x) - P(z) = (x-z)Q(x), but maybe just as a random element included in the proof?
	// This is confusing because it deviates from standard polynomial IOPs.

	// Let's revert to the more standard polynomial IOP concept:
	// Prover proves P(w) = target by constructing P(x) and proving P(x) - target has root w.
	// This is equivalent to proving (P(x)-target) / (x-w) is a valid polynomial Q(x).
	// Prover provides Comm(P-target) and Comm(Q).
	// Verifier checks relation based on commitments at a random point z.
	// Identity: (P(x)-target) = (x-w) * Q(x)
	// Evaluate at z: (P(z)-target) = (z-w) * Q(z)
	// Prover needs to provide P(z), Q(z), w, z in proof, plus commitments to (P-target) and Q.
	// Proof: Comm(P-target), Comm(Q), P(z), Q(z), w, z

	// This is getting complex while trying to avoid existing protocols.

	// Let's go back to the P(x)-P(z)=(x-z)Q(x) model, as it's common in modern ZKPs.
	// Statement implies P(x). Prover uses witness to instantiate P(x).
	// Prove knowledge of w such that P(w)=targetValue.
	// This implies the prover CAN construct P(x) such that P(w)=targetValue.
	// The check P(x) - P(z) = (x-z)Q(x) is the verification *mechanism*, not the statement itself.

	// Verifier receives proof with Comm(P), Comm(Q), P(z), z.
	// Verifier needs to check:
	// 1. Comm(P) is a valid commitment to the polynomial P that the statement implies *should* be zero at witness.
	//    How can verifier check this if they don't know P? This is where the PCS properties are crucial.
	//    Or the statement is encoded differently, e.g., P(x) = A(x)W(x) + B(x)I(x) + C(x)O(x) + D(x)H(x) based on R1CS.
	//    Verifier knows A, B, C, D polynomials (public), prover knows W, I, O, H (witness/internal wires).
	//    Statement check is (A(x)W(x) + ...) * Z(x) = T(x) * H(x) where Z is zero poly for evaluation domain.
	//    This is getting too deep into specific protocols.

	// --- Simplified Verification Logic (Re-attempt) ---
	// Given the limitations, the verification can only check consistency and structure,
	// *conceptually* standing in for the cryptographic checks.
	// The verifier checks that the provided evaluation at challenge P(z) is consistent with the polynomial identity.
	// Identity: P(x) - P(z) = (x-z) * Q(x)
	// Prover provides Comm(P), Comm(Q), P(z), z.
	// Verifier checks at point z:
	// P(z) - P(z) = (z-z) * Q(z)
	// 0 = 0 * Q(z)
	// This identity holds *trivially* at point z.
	// The power of ZKP comes from checking this identity holds for the *polynomials* via commitments,
	// which implies it holds at *all* points, including the secret witness 'w'.

	// Our simplified verification *cannot* verify the polynomial identity.
	// It can only verify:
	// 1. Challenge consistency (done).
	// 2. That the commitments are valid *format-wise* (done by CheckProofValidityStructure implicitly).
	// 3. That the claimed evaluation P(z) matches what P(x) *should be* based on public information... but verifier doesn't know P(x).

	// Let's define what VerifyKnowledgeOfPolyRelation actually does in this simplified model:
	// It checks Fiat-Shamir challenge consistency.
	// It assumes the Commitment Scheme is valid and the commitments Comm(P) and Comm(Q) correctly
	// represent *some* polynomials P_hat and Q_hat.
	// It *conceptually* verifies that P_hat(x) - proof.EvaluationAtChallenge == (x - proof.Challenge) * Q_hat(x).
	// Without a real PCS, this check is just a placeholder comment.

	fmt.Println("Verifier re-computing challenge...") // Already done above
	fmt.Println("Verifier conceptually verifying polynomial identity P(x) - P(z) = (x-z) * Q(x) using commitments...")
	// In a real ZKP:

	// 2. Use pairing checks or FRI to verify the relation holds between Comm(P), Comm(Q), P(z), and z.
	// Example KZG check for P(x) - P(z) = (x-z) Q(x):
	// e(Comm(P) - Comm(P(z) as const polynomial)), G2) == e(Comm(x-z as linear polynomial)), Comm(Q))
	// Where e is the pairing function.
	// This requires commitment to constant polynomial P(z) and linear polynomial (x-z).

	// Since we cannot perform the cryptographic check, we return true *if* the challenge is consistent,
	// indicating the prover followed the protocol, but without cryptographic assurance of the statement.
