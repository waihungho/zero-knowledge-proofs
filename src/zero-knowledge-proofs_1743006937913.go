// CommitmentScheme generates a commitment to a secret value.
// Summary: Takes a secret value (string) and generates a commitment and a reveal key (random nonce). The commitment hides the secret, and the reveal key is needed to later reveal the secret and allow verification of the commitment.  Uses a simple hash-based commitment for demonstration.

}

// RevealCommitment reveals the committed value and verifies the commitment.
// Summary: Takes a commitment, a revealed secret, and the reveal key (nonce). It re-computes the commitment using the revealed secret and reveal key and checks if it matches the original commitment, thus verifying that the secret was indeed committed to.

	return commitment == recomputedCommitment, nil
}

// ZeroKnowledgePasswordProof proves knowledge of a password without revealing the password itself.
// Summary:  The prover hashes the password and sends the hash (salt and hashed password in a real-world scenario, simplified here). The verifier compares this hash to a stored hash of the password. This is a very basic demonstration and NOT secure for real-world password authentication.  Real ZKP password proofs would be more complex (e.g., using Sigma protocols). This is for illustrative purposes of the ZKP concept in password context.

}

// ZeroKnowledgeEmailOwnershipProof proves ownership of an email address without revealing the full email, possibly using a domain-specific challenge.
// Summary:  Prover takes an email, extracts the domain. Verifier sends a challenge specific to that domain (e.g., "Prove you control example.com DNS"). Prover, if owning the email, can respond to the domain-specific challenge (e.g., by modifying DNS records temporarily and providing proof of modification). This function outlines the *concept* - actual implementation needs domain-specific challenge-response mechanisms.
func ZeroKnowledgeEmailOwnershipProof(email string, domainChallenge string, proverResponse string) (bool, error) {
	if !strings.Contains(email, "@") {
		return false, errors.New("invalid email format")
	}
	domain := strings.Split(email, "@")[1]

	// In a real system, 'domainChallenge' would be dynamically generated and specific to 'domain'.
	// 'proverResponse' would be the proof of completing the domain-specific challenge.

	// Simplified check:  Assume a trivial challenge is just to provide the domain name back as a "proof"
	expectedResponse := domain
	return proverResponse == expectedResponse && domainChallenge == "Prove you control "+domain, nil
}

// ZeroKnowledgeAgeVerification proves that a person is above a certain age without revealing their exact age.
// Summary:  Prover has their age. Prover generates a commitment to their age. Prover also provides a ZKP that the committed age is greater than or equal to the required age. Verifier checks the ZKP and the commitment (optionally later revealed if needed for audit, though ideally not).  This function outlines the conceptual steps. A real range proof or comparison proof is needed for the ZKP part.
func ZeroKnowledgeAgeVerification(age int, requiredAge int) (proof string, err error) {
	if age < requiredAge {
		return "", errors.New("age is below required age, cannot generate proof")
	}

	// In a real ZKP system, 'proof' would be a complex cryptographic proof.
	// Here, we simplify by just returning a string indicating successful proof generation if age is sufficient.

	proof = "AgeVerificationProofGenerated" // Placeholder - replace with actual ZKP generation
	return proof, nil
}

// ZeroKnowledgeLocationProximityProof proves that a user is within a certain proximity to a specific location without revealing the exact location.
// Summary: Prover has their GPS coordinates.  Prover and Verifier agree on a target location and a proximity radius. Prover calculates the distance to the target location. Prover generates a ZKP that the calculated distance is less than or equal to the proximity radius. Verifier checks the ZKP.  This function outlines the concept. A real range proof or comparison proof on distance is needed for the ZKP part.  Distance calculation would be done using Haversine formula or similar in a real implementation.
func ZeroKnowledgeLocationProximityProof(userLatitude float64, userLongitude float64, targetLatitude float64, targetLongitude float64, proximityRadius float64) (proof string, err error) {
	// Placeholder for distance calculation (Haversine formula would be used in real implementation)
	distance := calculateDistance(userLatitude, userLongitude, targetLatitude, targetLongitude)

	if distance > proximityRadius {
		return "", errors.New("user is not within proximity radius, cannot generate proof")
	}

	return proof, nil

	// Simplified placeholder - returns a dummy distance based on longitude difference
	return abs(lon1 - lon2) * 100 // Just for demonstration, not real distance
}

func abs(x float64) float64 {
	if x < 0 {
		return -x
	}
	return x
}

// ZeroKnowledgeSkillEndorsementProof proves that a user has been endorsed for a skill by a trusted party without revealing the endorser's identity publicly.
// Summary: Endorser (trusted party) digitally signs a statement like "User X is skilled in Y".  Prover (User X) presents this signed statement as proof. Verifier checks the signature against the endorser's public key.  The signature itself acts as a ZKP - it proves endorsement without revealing *which* specific endorsement occurred among potentially many endorsements by the same endorser if endorsements are general enough (e.g., endorsements for "skill in programming" rather than specific project endorsements).  This is a simplified form of ZKP endorsement; more advanced schemes could use aggregate signatures or ring signatures for better anonymity of endorsers in larger systems.
func ZeroKnowledgeSkillEndorsementProof(signedEndorsement string, endorserPublicKey string) (bool, error) {
	// Placeholder for signature verification. In a real system, use crypto libraries to verify digital signature.
	// Here, we just do a string comparison for demonstration.
	expectedSignaturePrefix := "ValidSignatureFrom_" + endorserPublicKey // Dummy check
	return strings.HasPrefix(signedEndorsement, expectedSignaturePrefix), nil
}

// ZeroKnowledgeDataIntegrityProof proves the integrity of a dataset without revealing the dataset itself, using Merkle trees or similar structures.
// Summary:  Dataset is structured as a Merkle Tree. Prover provides the Merkle root hash (commitment to the entire dataset). Prover, to prove integrity of a specific data chunk, provides a Merkle path (authentication path) to the verifier. Verifier can verify the path against the Merkle root without seeing the entire dataset. This function outlines the *concept*. Actual Merkle Tree implementation and path generation/verification are needed.
func ZeroKnowledgeDataIntegrityProof(merkleRootHash string, dataChunkIndex int, merklePath string) (bool, error) {
	// Placeholder -  In a real system, 'merklePath' would be used to recompute part of the Merkle tree
	// and verify against 'merkleRootHash'.
	// Here, we just do a dummy check based on index.
	expectedPathPrefix := "ValidMerklePathForIndex_" + strconv.Itoa(dataChunkIndex) // Dummy check
	return strings.HasPrefix(merklePath, expectedPathPrefix) && merkleRootHash == "KnownMerkleRootHash", nil
}

// ZeroKnowledgePrivateSetIntersection allows two parties to compute the intersection of their sets without revealing the sets themselves to each other.
// Summary: Uses cryptographic techniques like homomorphic encryption or oblivious transfer (OT).  Simplified conceptual outline: Parties encrypt their sets. They perform computations on encrypted sets to find the intersection. Only the intersection (or information about the intersection size) is revealed, and the original sets remain private. This function is a placeholder for a complex cryptographic protocol.
func ZeroKnowledgePrivateSetIntersection(partyASet []string, partyBSet []string) (intersectionSize int, err error) {
	// Placeholder - In a real system, this would involve complex crypto protocols (Homomorphic Encryption, OT).
	// Simplified simulation:  Just compute the intersection directly for demonstration, but in ZKP it would be done without revealing sets.
	intersection := 0
	for _, itemA := range partyASet {
		for _, itemB := range partyBSet {
			if itemA == itemB {
				intersection++
				break // Avoid counting duplicates
			}
		}
	}
	return intersection, nil // In ZKP, only 'intersectionSize' would be revealed, not the actual items.
}

// ZeroKnowledgeRangeProof proves that a number lies within a specific range without revealing the exact number.
// Summary: Prover has a secret number. Prover generates a ZKP using range proof protocols (e.g., Bulletproofs, Range proofs based on Pedersen commitments). Verifier checks the ZKP.  This function is a placeholder for a range proof protocol implementation.
func ZeroKnowledgeRangeProof(secretNumber int, minRange int, maxRange int) (proof string, err error) {
	if secretNumber < minRange || secretNumber > maxRange {
		return "", errors.New("secret number is outside the specified range, cannot generate proof")
	}
	// Placeholder - In a real system, 'proof' would be a cryptographic range proof.
	proof = "RangeProofGenerated" // Placeholder - replace with actual range proof generation
	return proof, nil
}

// ZeroKnowledgePolynomialEvaluationProof proves the correct evaluation of a polynomial at a secret point without revealing the polynomial or the point.
// Summary: Prover knows a polynomial P(x) and a secret point 'a'. Prover computes y = P(a). Prover generates a ZKP to prove that y is indeed the correct evaluation of P(x) at 'a' without revealing P(x) or 'a' directly to the verifier.  This is a placeholder for a polynomial commitment scheme and evaluation proof.
func ZeroKnowledgePolynomialEvaluationProof(polynomialCoefficients []int, secretPoint int, evaluationResult int) (proof string, err error) {
	// Placeholder - In a real system, this involves polynomial commitment schemes and evaluation proofs.
	// Simplified check: Just evaluate the polynomial and compare.  In ZKP, this evaluation and comparison would be proven zero-knowledge.
	calculatedEvaluation := evaluatePolynomial(polynomialCoefficients, secretPoint)
	if calculatedEvaluation != evaluationResult {
		return "", errors.New("polynomial evaluation is incorrect, cannot generate proof")
	}
	proof = "PolynomialEvaluationProofGenerated" // Placeholder - replace with actual ZKP generation
	return proof, nil
}

func evaluatePolynomial(coefficients []int, x int) int {
	result := 0
	powerOfX := 1
	for _, coeff := range coefficients {
		result += coeff * powerOfX
		powerOfX *= x
	}
	return result
}

// ZeroKnowledgeGraphColoringProof (Simplified) proves that a graph is colorable with a certain number of colors without revealing the actual coloring.
// Summary: Prover has a valid coloring of a graph. Prover generates a ZKP using graph coloring proof protocols. Verifier checks the ZKP.  This is a placeholder for a graph coloring ZKP protocol.  Graph representation and coloring algorithms are needed for a real implementation.  Simplified here to just always return a successful proof for demonstration (assuming the graph *is* colorable and prover *has* a coloring).
func ZeroKnowledgeGraphColoringProof(graph string, numColors int) (proof string, err error) {
	// Placeholder - In a real system, this involves graph representation, coloring algorithms, and graph coloring ZKP protocols.
	// Simplified: Assume graph is colorable and proof can always be generated.
	proof = "GraphColoringProofGenerated" // Placeholder - replace with actual ZKP generation
	return proof, nil
}

// ZeroKnowledgeMachineLearningModelUsageProof proves usage of a specific ML model (e.g., for inference) without revealing the model's parameters or architecture.
// Summary:  Prover uses a specific ML model to perform inference on input data. Prover generates a ZKP that proves the inference was performed using *that specific* model (identified by a hash of its parameters or architecture) and that the output is consistent with the model's behavior, without revealing the model's parameters or full architecture to the verifier. This is a highly conceptual function. ZKP for ML is an active research area.  Likely involves cryptographic commitments to model parameters and zero-knowledge computations on encrypted data.
func ZeroKnowledgeMachineLearningModelUsageProof(modelIdentifierHash string, inputData string, inferenceOutput string) (proof string, err error) {
	// Placeholder - ZKP for ML is complex. This is a conceptual outline.
	// Simplified check: Just check if the model identifier hash is known.
	if modelIdentifierHash != "KnownMLModelHash" {
		return "", errors.New("unknown ML model identifier")
	}
	proof = "MLModelUsageProofGenerated" // Placeholder - replace with actual ZKP for ML inference
	return proof, nil
}

// ZeroKnowledgeBlockchainTransactionLinkProof proves that two transactions on a blockchain are linked (e.g., part of the same larger operation) without revealing transaction details.
// Summary:  Transactions on a blockchain might have linking information (e.g., shared nonce, specific output from one used as input to another, metadata). Prover, having access to transaction data, can generate a ZKP based on these linking properties. Verifier, given transaction IDs, can check the ZKP against public blockchain data (hashes, block headers, etc.) to verify the link without seeing the full transaction content. This function is conceptual.  Needs blockchain-specific linking properties and ZKP protocol tailored to those properties.
func ZeroKnowledgeBlockchainTransactionLinkProof(transactionID1 string, transactionID2 string, linkType string) (proof string, err error) {
	// Placeholder - Blockchain ZKP for transaction linking is specific to blockchain structure and linking mechanisms.
	// Simplified check: Assume link type is "SimpleLink" and IDs are known.
	if linkType != "SimpleLink" || transactionID1 != "TXN1" || transactionID2 != "TXN2" {
		return "", errors.New("invalid link type or transaction IDs")
	}
	proof = "BlockchainTransactionLinkProofGenerated" // Placeholder - replace with actual blockchain ZKP
	return proof, nil
}

// ZeroKnowledgeReputationScoreProof proves that a user's reputation score is above a certain threshold without revealing the exact score.
// Summary: Prover has a reputation score. Prover generates a ZKP using range proof or comparison proof techniques to prove that their score is greater than or equal to the threshold. Verifier checks the ZKP.  Similar to ZeroKnowledgeRangeProof and ZeroKnowledgeAgeVerification but specifically for reputation scores.
func ZeroKnowledgeReputationScoreProof(reputationScore int, scoreThreshold int) (proof string, err error) {
	if reputationScore < scoreThreshold {
		return "", errors.New("reputation score is below threshold, cannot generate proof")
	}
	proof = "ReputationScoreProofGenerated" // Placeholder - replace with actual ZKP range/comparison proof
	return proof, nil
}

// ZeroKnowledgeEligibilityProof proves that a user is eligible for a certain condition (e.g., loan, service) based on hidden criteria without revealing the criteria itself.
// Summary: Eligibility is determined by a set of hidden criteria (e.g., income, credit score, location). Prover has data satisfying these criteria. Prover generates a ZKP that proves they meet the eligibility criteria *without revealing* the specific criteria or their underlying data. Verifier checks the ZKP. This is a generalized concept. ZKP needs to be tailored to the specific eligibility conditions and how they are evaluated.  Could use predicate proofs or more complex constructions.
func ZeroKnowledgeEligibilityProof(eligibilityCriteriaType string, userProvidedData string) (proof string, err error) {
	// Placeholder - Eligibility ZKP is very application-specific.
	// Simplified check: Assume criteria type is "BasicLoanEligibility" and data is "MeetsCriteria" for demonstration.
	if eligibilityCriteriaType != "BasicLoanEligibility" || userProvidedData != "MeetsCriteria" {
		return "", errors.New("user data does not meet eligibility criteria")
	}
	proof = "EligibilityProofGenerated" // Placeholder - replace with actual eligibility ZKP
	return proof, nil
}

// ZeroKnowledgeMultiFactorAuthenticationProof integrates multiple factors (knowledge, possession, inherence) into a ZKP for stronger authentication without revealing factor details.
// Summary:  Authentication requires proving knowledge of a password, possession of a device (e.g., via a signed challenge from the device), and optionally inherence (biometrics, though simplified here). Prover generates a combined ZKP proving all factors are satisfied without revealing the password, device secret, or biometric data directly.  This is a conceptual outline. ZKP needs to combine proofs for each factor securely.
func ZeroKnowledgeMultiFactorAuthenticationProof(passwordProof string, devicePossessionProof string, inherenceFactorProof string) (proof string, err error) {
	// Placeholder - Multi-factor ZKP needs to combine individual factor proofs securely.
	// Simplified check: Just check if individual proofs are "ValidProof" for demonstration.
	if passwordProof != "ValidPasswordProof" || devicePossessionProof != "ValidDeviceProof" || inherenceFactorProof != "ValidInherenceProof" {
		return "", errors.New("multi-factor authentication failed - one or more factor proofs invalid")
	}
	proof = "MultiFactorAuthenticationProofGenerated" // Placeholder - replace with actual multi-factor ZKP
	return proof, nil
}

// ZeroKnowledgeAnonymousVotingProof allows users to vote anonymously while proving their eligibility to vote without revealing their identity or vote.
// Summary:  Voters are registered and eligible. Each voter generates a ZKP proving their eligibility to vote (e.g., based on a voter ID and some secret).  Voters then submit their votes along with the eligibility ZKP.  Votes are aggregated anonymously.  The ZKP ensures only eligible voters can vote, and anonymity is maintained through cryptographic techniques (e.g., mix-nets, verifiable shuffles). This is a high-level concept.  Anonymous voting ZKP is complex and involves various cryptographic components.
func ZeroKnowledgeAnonymousVotingProof(voterID string, vote string) (eligibilityProof string, voteProof string, err error) {
	// Placeholder - Anonymous voting ZKP is complex and involves several steps.
	// Simplified check: Assume voter ID is valid and vote is recorded.
	if voterID != "ValidVoterID" {
		return "", "", errors.New("invalid voter ID, cannot generate eligibility proof")
	}
	eligibilityProof = "AnonymousVotingEligibilityProofGenerated" // Placeholder - replace with actual ZKP for eligibility
	voteProof = "AnonymousVoteSubmitted"                       // Placeholder - vote submission would be part of a broader anonymous voting protocol
	return eligibilityProof, voteProof, nil
}

// ZeroKnowledgePrivateDataQueryProof proves that a query on a private database returned a valid result without revealing the query or the database content.
// Summary:  User wants to query a private database (e.g., "find users with age > 25"). User constructs a query.  User and database server engage in a ZKP protocol where the server proves that the query result is correct *according to the database* without revealing the database content or the exact query details (beyond what's necessary for query execution). This is a conceptual outline.  Private database query ZKP is an active research area, often using techniques like secure multi-party computation or homomorphic encryption.
func ZeroKnowledgePrivateDataQueryProof(queryDescription string, queryResult string) (validResultProof string, err error) {
	// Placeholder - Private database query ZKP is complex and depends on database structure and query type.
	// Simplified check: Assume query description is "AgeGreaterThan25" and result is "ValidResult".
	if queryDescription != "AgeGreaterThan25" || queryResult != "ValidResult" {
		return "", errors.New("invalid query description or result")
	}
	validResultProof = "PrivateDataQueryResultProofGenerated" // Placeholder - replace with actual ZKP for private query
	return validResultProof, nil
}

// ZeroKnowledgeGameMoveValidityProof In a game, proves that a move is valid according to the game rules without revealing the move itself to the opponent before execution.
// Summary: In a turn-based game, a player makes a move.  Player generates a ZKP that their move is valid according to the game's rules given the current game state. The ZKP is sent to the opponent (or game server). The opponent (or server) verifies the ZKP. If valid, the move is executed.  The ZKP prevents cheating by ensuring moves are legal without revealing the move strategy to the opponent beforehand.  Game rules need to be formally encoded for ZKP generation and verification.
func ZeroKnowledgeGameMoveValidityProof(gameName string, gameState string, proposedMove string) (moveValidityProof string, err error) {
	// Placeholder - Game move ZKP depends heavily on specific game rules.
	// Simplified check: Assume game is "Chess" and move is "ValidMove" given game state "InitialState".
	if gameName != "Chess" || gameState != "InitialState" || proposedMove != "ValidMove" {
		return "", errors.New("invalid game name, state, or proposed move")
	}
	moveValidityProof = "GameMoveValidityProofGenerated" // Placeholder - replace with actual ZKP for game move validity
	return moveValidityProof, nil
}

// ZeroKnowledgeIdentityVerificationProof (Generalized) A flexible framework for proving identity attributes without revealing specific identity information.
// Summary:  A generalized framework where identity attributes are represented as claims (e.g., "is citizen of country X", "has driver's license", "age > 18").  Prover has identity information. Prover generates ZKPs for specific claims they want to prove, based on their identity data, without revealing the underlying identity data itself. Verifier checks the ZKPs for the claims they require. This is a conceptual framework. Specific ZKP techniques (attribute-based credentials, selective disclosure) are needed for implementation.
func ZeroKnowledgeIdentityVerificationProof(identityAttributes map[string]interface{}, claimsToProve []string) (proofs map[string]string, err error) {
	proofs = make(map[string]string)
	for _, claim := range claimsToProve {
		attributeValue, exists := identityAttributes[claim]
		if !exists {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("identity attribute '%s' not found", claim)
		}
		// Placeholder - Generate ZKP for each claim based on attributeValue.
		// For simplicity, assume if attribute exists, proof can be generated.
		proofs[claim] = "ZKProofFor_" + claim + "_Generated" // Placeholder - replace with actual ZKP generation
	}
	return proofs, nil
}

// ZeroKnowledgeAI-Generated Content Authenticity Proof Proves that content (text, image, etc.) was generated by a specific AI model without revealing the model fully or the generation process.
// Summary:  AI model (e.g., text generator, image generator) has a unique identifier (hash of model parameters or architecture). When generating content, the model can also produce a ZKP that proves the content was generated by *that specific model* without revealing the model's details or the full generation process.  Verifier can check this ZKP to verify content authenticity.  This is a very trendy and forward-looking concept. ZKP for AI-generated content is a very nascent research area. Likely involves cryptographic signatures based on model identifiers or zero-knowledge proofs related to the generation process.
func ZeroKnowledgeAIGeneratedContentAuthenticityProof(content string, modelIdentifierHash string) (authenticityProof string, err error) {
	// Placeholder - ZKP for AI-generated content is a very new and complex area.
	// Simplified check: Just check if model identifier hash is known.
	if modelIdentifierHash != "KnownAIModelHashForContentGeneration" {
		return "", errors.New("unknown AI model identifier")
	}
	authenticityProof = "AIGeneratedContentAuthenticityProofGenerated" // Placeholder - replace with actual ZKP for AI content origin
	return authenticityProof, nil
}
