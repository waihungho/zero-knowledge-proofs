/*
Outline and Function Summary:

This Go package implements a Zero-Knowledge Proof system for a decentralized secure auction.
The auction allows bidders to place bids, prove they have sufficient funds, and verify auction integrity without revealing sensitive information like bid amounts or account balances directly.

**Core Concept:**  Commitment Schemes and Range Proofs (simplified for demonstration)

**Functions (20+):**

**1. Auction Setup & Management:**
    - `CreateAuction(auctioneerID string, itemName string, minBidAmount int) *Auction`: Initializes a new auction with item details and minimum bid.
    - `GetAuctionDetails(auction *Auction) AuctionDetails`: Retrieves public details of an auction (item name, min bid).
    - `StartAuction(auction *Auction)`: Marks the auction as open for bidding.
    - `EndAuction(auction *Auction)`: Marks the auction as closed for bidding.
    - `CancelAuction(auction *Auction)`: Cancels an auction and refunds deposits (hypothetical).

**2. Bidder Actions & ZKP for Bids:**
    - `GenerateBidCommitment(bidderID string, bidAmount int, secret string) (Commitment, error)`:  Generates a commitment for a bid amount, hiding the actual bid.
    - `ProveBidAmountHidden(commitment Commitment) Proof`: Generates a ZKP that a commitment is indeed a valid bid commitment (basic proof of construction).  (Simplified for demonstration).
    - `VerifyBidAmountHidden(commitment Commitment, proof Proof) bool`: Verifies the proof that a commitment is a valid bid commitment.
    - `RevealBid(commitment Commitment, secret string) (int, error)`: Reveals the bid amount associated with a commitment using the secret.
    - `VerifyBidRevealed(commitment Commitment, revealedBid int, secret string) bool`: Verifies that the revealed bid matches the original commitment and secret.
    - `PlaceBid(auction *Auction, bidderID string, commitment Commitment, fundsProof Proof) error`: Allows a bidder to place a bid with a commitment and proof of funds.

**3. Funds Proof & Verification (Range Proof - Simplified):**
    - `GenerateFundsProof(userID string, balance int, bidAmount int, salt string) (Proof, error)`: Generates a simplified range proof-like proof that a user's balance is sufficient for a bid. (Not a true cryptographic range proof, but demonstrates the concept).
    - `VerifyFundsProof(userID string, proof Proof, bidAmount int) bool`: Verifies the simplified funds proof, ensuring the user *claims* to have enough funds for the bid.

**4. Auction Integrity & Verification:**
    - `ProveAuctioneerIntegrity(auction *Auction, secretAuctioneerKey string) Proof`: Auctioneer generates a proof of auction integrity, showing they followed fair rules (e.g., no bid manipulation - highly simplified).
    - `VerifyAuctioneerIntegrity(auction *Auction, proof Proof) bool`: Verifies the auctioneer's integrity proof.
    - `SelectWinner(auction *Auction) (string, int, error)`:  Selects the winner based on revealed bids (after auction end).
    - `ProveWinnerSelectionCorrect(auction *Auction, winnerBidderID string, winnerBidAmount int, secretAuctioneerKey string) Proof`:  Auctioneer generates a proof that the winner selection was done correctly based on bid amounts.
    - `VerifyWinnerSelectionCorrect(auction *Auction, winnerBidderID string, winnerBidAmount int, proof Proof) bool`: Verifies the winner selection correctness proof.

**5. Utility Functions:**
    - `GenerateRandomSecret() string`: Generates a random secret for commitments.
    - `HashData(data string) string`:  A simple hashing function for commitments and proofs. (In real ZKP, cryptographic hash functions are essential).


**Important Notes:**

* **Simplified ZKP:** This code provides a simplified, illustrative example of ZKP concepts. It does NOT use cryptographically secure ZKP protocols like zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, or Bulletproofs.
* **Commitment Scheme:** The commitment scheme is a basic hashing approach, not cryptographically strong.
* **Range Proof:** The "funds proof" is a very simplified demonstration and not a true range proof. Real range proofs are complex cryptographic constructions.
* **Security:**  This code is for educational purposes and is NOT suitable for production use in secure auctions.  Real-world ZKP implementations require rigorous cryptographic design and libraries.
* **Advanced Concepts (Simplified):** The example touches upon concepts like commitments, proofs, and verification in a ZKP context, but simplifies the underlying cryptography significantly.
* **Creativity & Trend:**  The "decentralized secure auction" scenario is a relevant and trendy application of ZKP in areas like DeFi and secure voting.
* **No Duplication (from Open Source):** This implementation is designed to be a conceptual demonstration and avoids directly copying existing open-source ZKP libraries. It focuses on illustrating the function flow and high-level ideas.

To build a truly secure and practical ZKP auction system, you would need to use established cryptographic libraries and implement robust ZKP protocols. This code serves as a starting point for understanding the conceptual application of ZKP in a creative scenario.
