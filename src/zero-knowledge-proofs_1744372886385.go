Outline and Function Summary:

Package: zkpsupplychain

This package demonstrates Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) in the context of a trendy and advanced application:
**Verifiable and Private Supply Chain Provenance & Compliance.**

Instead of just proving simple statements, we focus on enabling various actors in a supply chain to prove properties about products, processes, or their compliance without revealing sensitive underlying data.

**Core ZKP Functions (Primitives):**

1.  `GenerateRandomScalar()`: Generates a random scalar (representing a secret value) for cryptographic operations. (Helper function)
2.  `CommitToValue(secret Scalar) (Commitment, CommitmentOpening)`:  Creates a commitment to a secret value, hiding the value itself. Returns the commitment and the opening (used later to reveal and verify).
3.  `VerifyCommitment(commitment Commitment, value Scalar, opening CommitmentOpening) bool`: Verifies that a revealed value corresponds to a previously created commitment using the opening.
4.  `CreateRangeProof(value int, min int, max int, secret Scalar) (RangeProof, RangeProofOpening)`: Creates a ZKP that proves a value is within a given range [min, max] without revealing the exact value.
5.  `VerifyRangeProof(proof RangeProof, min int, max int, commitment Commitment, opening CommitmentOpening) bool`: Verifies a RangeProof against a commitment, ensuring the committed value is within the specified range.
6.  `CreateSetMembershipProof(value string, allowedSet []string, secret Scalar) (SetMembershipProof, SetMembershipProofOpening)`: Creates a ZKP that proves a value belongs to a predefined set of allowed values without revealing the specific value.
7.  `VerifySetMembershipProof(proof SetMembershipProof, allowedSet []string, commitment Commitment, opening CommitmentOpening) bool`: Verifies a SetMembershipProof against a commitment, confirming the committed value is in the allowed set.
8.  `CreatePredicateProof(statement string, data map[string]interface{}, secret Scalar) (PredicateProof, PredicateProofOpening)`:  Creates a ZKP for a more complex predicate or statement about data (e.g., "temperature is below threshold AND origin is certified").  This is more abstract and requires defining a predicate language.
9.  `VerifyPredicateProof(proof PredicateProof, statement string, commitmentMap map[string]Commitment, openingMap map[string]CommitmentOpening) bool`: Verifies a PredicateProof against a set of commitments and openings, checking if the statement holds true for the committed data.
10. `CreateOwnershipProof(itemIdentifier string, ownerIdentifier string, secret Scalar) (OwnershipProof, OwnershipProofOpening)`: Proves that a specific owner controls or owns a particular item in the supply chain, without revealing the exact mechanism of ownership (e.g., private key, authorization).
11. `VerifyOwnershipProof(proof OwnershipProof, itemIdentifier string, ownerIdentifier string, commitment Commitment, opening CommitmentOpening) bool`: Verifies the OwnershipProof, ensuring the claimed owner is indeed authorized for the item.

**Supply Chain Specific ZKP Functions (Applications):**

12. `ProveEthicalSourcing(supplierCertification string, secret Scalar) (EthicalSourcingProof, EthicalSourcingProofOpening)`: Proves that a product is ethically sourced based on a certification (e.g., Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance) without revealing the specific supplier details or audit reports.
13. `VerifyEthicalSourcingProof(proof EthicalSourcingProof, commitment Commitment, opening CommitmentOpening) bool`: Verifies the EthicalSourcingProof, confirming the product meets ethical sourcing standards.
14. `ProveSustainableManufacturing(energyConsumption int, wasteProduction int, secret Scalar) (SustainableManufacturingProof, SustainableManufacturingProofOpening)`: Proves that a manufacturing process is sustainable based on metrics like energy consumption and waste production, without revealing exact production figures or proprietary processes. Uses RangeProofs internally.
15. `VerifySustainableManufacturingProof(proof SustainableManufacturingProof, commitmentMap map[string]Commitment, openingMap map[string]CommitmentOpening) bool`: Verifies the SustainableManufacturingProof, ensuring the process meets sustainability criteria.
16. `ProveRegulatoryCompliance(region string, regulationID string, complianceData map[string]interface{}, secret Scalar) (RegulatoryComplianceProof, RegulatoryComplianceProofOpening)`: Proves compliance with specific regulations in a given region, based on compliance data, without revealing all the detailed data points. Uses PredicateProofs internally for complex rules.
17. `VerifyRegulatoryComplianceProof(proof RegulatoryComplianceProof, region string, regulationID string, commitmentMap map[string]Commitment, openingMap map[string]CommitmentOpening) bool`: Verifies the RegulatoryComplianceProof, ensuring compliance with the specified regulation.
18. `ProveTemperatureIntegrity(temperatureReadings []int, acceptableRange [2]int, secret Scalar) (TemperatureIntegrityProof, TemperatureIntegrityProofOpening)`: Proves that temperature readings during transit or storage remained within an acceptable range, crucial for perishable goods, without revealing all individual readings. Uses RangeProofs aggregated or applied to summary statistics.
19. `VerifyTemperatureIntegrityProof(proof TemperatureIntegrityProof, acceptableRange [2]int, commitment Commitment, opening CommitmentOpening) bool`: Verifies the TemperatureIntegrityProof, confirming temperature integrity was maintained.
20. `ProveAuthenticity(productID string, origin string, batchNumber string, secret Scalar) (AuthenticityProof, AuthenticityProofOpening)`: Proves the authenticity of a product, verifying its origin and batch number against a trusted registry, without revealing the underlying registry data or specific lookup details. Uses SetMembership or Predicate Proofs.
21. `VerifyAuthenticityProof(proof AuthenticityProof, productID string, commitmentMap map[string]Commitment, openingMap map[string]CommitmentOpening) bool`: Verifies the AuthenticityProof, confirming the product's claimed authenticity.
22. `ProveLocationHistory(locationPoints []string, authorizedRegions []string, secret Scalar) (LocationHistoryProof, LocationHistoryProofOpening)`: Proves that a product's location history (simplified to points) has always been within authorized regions, without revealing the exact path or all location points. Uses SetMembership proofs for each location.
23. `VerifyLocationHistoryProof(proof LocationHistoryProof, authorizedRegions []string, commitment Commitment, opening CommitmentOpening) bool`: Verifies the LocationHistoryProof, confirming the product stayed within authorized regions.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Simplification for Demonstration:** This code is a conceptual outline and demonstration. Actual cryptographic implementations of ZKPs are complex and require robust cryptographic libraries (e.g., using elliptic curves, hash functions, etc.).  This example uses placeholder types (`Scalar`, `Commitment`, `Proof`, `Opening`) for clarity.
*   **Predicate Language:** The `PredicateProof` functions would require defining a simple language or structure to represent the statements being proven (e.g., using JSON or a custom DSL).
*   **Efficiency and Security:**  Real-world ZKP systems need to be carefully designed for efficiency (proof size, verification time) and security (resistance to attacks). This outline does not address these aspects in detail.
*   **Underlying Cryptography:**  A production-ready implementation would require choosing specific ZKP schemes (e.g., Schnorr, Bulletproofs, zk-SNARKs/STARKs depending on the specific needs and trade-offs).
*   **Scalability:** For large supply chains, scalability and efficient aggregation of proofs are crucial considerations.

This example aims to showcase the *potential* of ZKPs in creating more transparent and privacy-preserving supply chains by allowing for verifiable claims without revealing sensitive data.
