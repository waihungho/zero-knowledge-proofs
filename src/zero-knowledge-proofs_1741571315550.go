// # Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Go: Verifiable Digital Asset Properties

/*
**Outline and Function Summary:**

This code demonstrates Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) in Go for verifying properties of digital assets without revealing the asset itself.
Imagine a scenario where users own digital assets (represented abstractly here) and want to prove certain attributes or operations
related to these assets to a verifier without disclosing the underlying asset data or the full operation details.

**Functions (20+):**

**1. Key Generation & Setup:**
    * `GenerateKeys()`: Generates a pair of public and private keys for a user (prover).

**2. Basic Commitment & Opening:**
    * `CommitToAsset(assetData string, privateKey string)`:  Commits to an asset using a commitment scheme (e.g., hashing with a salt).
    * `OpenCommitment(commitment string, assetData string, privateKey string)`: Opens a commitment to reveal the original asset data and verify the commitment.

**3. Proof of Knowledge (Simplified):**
    * `ProveAssetKnowledge(assetData string, publicKey string, privateKey string)`: Proves knowledge of an asset without revealing the asset data itself (simplified example using hash challenge).
    * `VerifyAssetKnowledge(proof string, publicKey string, commitment string)`: Verifies the proof of asset knowledge against a commitment.

**4. Proof of Asset Value Range:**
    * `ProveAssetValueInRange(assetValue int, minValue int, maxValue int, privateKey string)`: Proves that the value of an asset falls within a specified range [minValue, maxValue] without revealing the exact value.
    * `VerifyAssetValueInRange(proof string, minValue int, maxValue int, publicKey string, commitment string)`: Verifies the range proof for an asset commitment.

**5. Proof of Asset Attribute Existence (Boolean):**
    * `ProveAssetHasAttribute(assetData string, attributeName string, privateKey string)`: Proves that an asset possesses a certain attribute (e.g., "isCollectible") without revealing other asset details.
    * `VerifyAssetHasAttribute(proof string, attributeName string, publicKey string, commitment string)`: Verifies the attribute existence proof.

**6. Proof of Asset Attribute Value (Specific):**
    * `ProveAssetAttributeValue(assetData string, attributeName string, attributeValue string, privateKey string)`: Proves that an asset has a specific attribute value (e.g., "rarity = 'rare'") without revealing other asset details.
    * `VerifyAssetAttributeValue(proof string, attributeName string, attributeValue string, publicKey string, commitment string)`: Verifies the specific attribute value proof.

**7. Proof of Asset Operation (Simplified - e.g., Transfer):**
    * `ProveAssetOperation(assetData string, operationType string, recipientPublicKey string, privateKey string)`:  Proves a simplified operation (like a transfer) on an asset without revealing full details, focusing on the *intent* to operate.
    * `VerifyAssetOperation(proof string, operationType string, recipientPublicKey string, publicKey string, commitment string)`: Verifies the simplified operation proof.

**8. Proof of Asset Uniqueness (within a set):**
    * `ProveAssetUniqueness(assetData string, assetSetHashes []string, privateKey string)`: Proves that an asset is unique within a given set of asset hashes (commitments) without revealing which specific asset it is.
    * `VerifyAssetUniqueness(proof string, assetSetHashes []string, publicKey string, commitment string)`: Verifies the uniqueness proof.

    * `ProveAssetOwnershipTransferIntent(assetData string, newOwnerPublicKey string, privateKey string)`:  Proves the *intent* to transfer asset ownership to a new owner without revealing the asset details fully.
    * `VerifyAssetOwnershipTransferIntent(proof string, newOwnerPublicKey string, publicKey string, commitment string)`: Verifies the ownership transfer intent proof.

**11. Proof of Asset Metadata Compliance (Simplified - e.g., format):**
    * `ProveAssetMetadataCompliance(assetData string, complianceRules string, privateKey string)`: Proves that the asset metadata adheres to certain compliance rules (simplified rule representation).

    * `VerifyAssetValueAndAttributeCombined(proof string, minValue int, maxValue int, attributeName string, publicKey string, commitment string)`: Verifies the combined proof.

**Important Notes:**

* **Simplification:** This code uses simplified cryptographic concepts for demonstration purposes. Real-world ZKPs often involve more complex mathematics and cryptographic primitives (e.g., elliptic curve cryptography, pairings, polynomial commitments, etc.).
* **Conceptual Focus:** The goal is to illustrate the *idea* of Zero-Knowledge Proofs and how they can be applied to various scenarios related to digital assets.
* **Security Disclaimer:** This code is NOT intended for production use. For real-world secure ZKP implementations, use established cryptographic libraries and consult with security experts.
* **Abstraction:** "assetData" is treated abstractly as a string. In a real system, it could represent structured data, binary data, or references to actual digital assets.
* **Creativity & Trendiness:** The functions are designed to be somewhat creative and touch upon trendy concepts like digital asset verification, privacy-preserving properties, and verifiable operations, without replicating existing open-source ZKP libraries directly in terms of specific algorithms. They aim for a higher-level application layer perspective.

**Explanation and Important Considerations:**

1.  **Simplified Cryptography:**  This code uses basic hashing (SHA256) as a core building block for commitments and simplified "proofs."  **It is crucial to understand that these are NOT cryptographically secure ZKP implementations in the real sense.** Real ZKPs rely on advanced mathematical structures and cryptographic primitives (like elliptic curve cryptography, pairings, polynomial commitments, etc.) to achieve true zero-knowledge and soundness.

2.  **Conceptual Demonstration:** The primary goal is to demonstrate the *concept* of Zero-Knowledge Proofs and how they can be applied to different scenarios related to digital assets. The functions are designed to be illustrative and creative, showcasing various types of proofs you might want to perform in a privacy-preserving digital asset system.

3.  **Abstraction of `assetData`:**  `assetData` is treated as a string for simplicity. In a real application, it could represent structured data (JSON, Protobuf), binary data (image, video), or references to actual digital assets stored elsewhere.

4.  **Simplified Proof Structures:** The proofs are generally structured as strings with colon-separated parts (e.g., `commitment:proofHash`).  Real ZKP proofs are often more complex data structures involving cryptographic elements.

5.  **Security Warnings:**  The code includes numerous `Warning` comments to emphasize that these are *not* secure ZKP implementations and are for conceptual demonstration only.  **Do not use this code for production or any security-sensitive applications.**

6.  **Creativity and Trendiness:** The functions are designed to be somewhat creative and touch upon trendy concepts in the digital asset space, such as:
    *   Verifying asset properties without revealing the asset itself.
    *   Proving operations on assets in a privacy-preserving way.
    *   Verifying compliance, origin, rarity, etc., without full disclosure.

7.  **No Duplication of Open Source (Intended):** While the fundamental ideas of ZKPs are well-established, the specific set of functions and simplified implementation in this code are designed to be unique and not directly replicate any particular open-source ZKP library. The focus is on demonstrating the *application* of ZKP concepts in a digital asset context, rather than implementing a specific cryptographic protocol from scratch.

**To Create Real-World Secure ZKPs:**

*   **Use Established Libraries:**  For production-level ZKPs, you would use well-vetted cryptographic libraries and frameworks that implement proven ZKP protocols (e.g., libraries for zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs, etc.).
*   **Study Cryptography:**  Deeply understand the mathematical and cryptographic principles behind ZKPs.
*   **Consult Experts:** Work with experienced cryptographers and security engineers to design and implement secure ZKP systems.

This Go code provides a starting point for understanding the *ideas* behind Zero-Knowledge Proofs in a practical context. Remember to treat it as a conceptual example and not a secure implementation.
