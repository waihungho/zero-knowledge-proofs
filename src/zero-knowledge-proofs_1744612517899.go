2. **Advanced ZKP Protocols:** Implementations of established and cutting-edge ZKP techniques.
3. **Application-Specific ZKPs:**  Zero-Knowledge proofs tailored for specific trendy applications (DeFi, AI, etc.).
4. **Utilities and Helper Functions:** Supporting functions for cryptographic operations and proof manipulation.

**1. Core ZKP Primitives:**

   * **CommitmentSchemePedersen(secret []byte, randomness []byte) (commitment []byte, decommitment []byte, err error):**
     - Summary: Implements a Pedersen commitment scheme. Prover commits to a secret value without revealing it, using a randomness value. Verifier can later verify the commitment against the revealed secret and decommitment.

   * **ProofSchnorrSignature(privateKey []byte, message []byte) (proof []byte, challenge []byte, err error):**
     - Summary: Generates a Schnorr signature-based zero-knowledge proof of knowledge of a private key corresponding to a public key, without revealing the private key itself.
     - Functionality: Creates a Schnorr proof that can be verified using the public key and message to confirm knowledge of the private key.

   * **ProofBulletproofRange(value int64, min int64, max int64, randomness []byte) (proof []byte, err error):**
     - Summary: Implements a Bulletproof for range proofs. Proves that a committed value lies within a specified range [min, max] without revealing the value itself.
     - Functionality: Generates a compact Bulletproof demonstrating that the 'value' is within the given range.

   * **ProofSigmaProtocolEquality(secret1 []byte, secret2 []byte, randomness1 []byte, randomness2 []byte) (proof []byte, err error):**
     - Summary:  Sigma protocol to prove that two commitments (e.g., Pedersen commitments) generated using different secrets and randomness values actually commit to the same underlying value.
     - Functionality:  Creates a proof showing equality of committed values without revealing the values.

   * **ProofZKPolynomialEvaluation(polynomialCoefficients []int64, point int64, secretInput int64, randomness []byte) (proof []byte, evaluationResult int64, err error):**
     - Summary: Zero-knowledge proof that the prover evaluated a polynomial at a specific point and obtained a certain result, without revealing the polynomial coefficients or the input point.

**2. Advanced ZKP Protocols:**

   * **ProofZKSetMembership(element []byte, set [][]byte, commitmentRandomness []byte) (proof []byte, commitment []byte, err error):**
     - Summary: Proof of set membership. Proves that a given element is part of a predefined set without revealing which element it is or the element itself.
     - Functionality:  Generates a ZKP showing that 'element' is in 'set' without revealing 'element'.

   * **ProofZKNonMembership(element []byte, set [][]byte, commitmentRandomness []byte) (proof []byte, commitment []byte, err error):**
     - Summary: Proof of non-membership. Proves that a given element is *not* part of a predefined set without revealing the element.

     - Functionality:  Implements a ZKP for verifiable random selection from a set.

   * **ProofZKVotingEligibility(voterID []byte, voterListMerkleRoot []byte, voterListMerkleProof [][]byte) (proof []byte, err error):**

**3. Application-Specific ZKPs:**

   * **ProofZKPrivateDataAggregation(userPrivateData [][]byte, aggregationFunction string, threshold int, randomnessList [][]byte) (proof []byte, aggregatedResult []byte, err error):**
     - Summary:  Zero-knowledge proof for private data aggregation. Multiple users can contribute private data (committed), and the system can compute an aggregate result (e.g., sum, average) and prove the correctness of the aggregation *without* revealing individual user data. 'aggregationFunction' could be "sum", "average", etc. 'threshold' could be minimum number of participants for aggregation.
     - Functionality: Enables privacy-preserving data aggregation with ZKP verification.

   * **ProofZKLoanEligibility(financialHistory []byte, creditScoreProof []byte, loanTerms []byte) (proof []byte, isEligible bool, err error):**
     - Summary:  Zero-knowledge proof for loan eligibility. A user can prove they meet certain loan eligibility criteria (e.g., credit score above a threshold, specific financial history) based on verifiable proofs without revealing their full financial history or exact credit score to the lender. 'creditScoreProof' could be a Bulletproof range proof.
     - Functionality:  Facilitates privacy-preserving loan applications with ZKP for eligibility proof.

   * **ProofZKPrivateAuctionBid(bidAmount int64, reservePrice int64, bidderPrivateKey []byte, randomness []byte) (proof []byte, committedBid []byte, err error):**
     - Summary: Zero-knowledge proof for private auction bids. A bidder can submit a bid in a committed form and provide a ZKP that their bid is at least a certain amount (e.g., above the reserve price) without revealing the exact bid amount until the auction ends (if they win or if bid revealing phase starts).

'dateProof' could be a commitment to birthdate or cryptographic signature from a trusted authority.
     - Functionality:  Provides privacy-preserving age verification using ZKP.

   * **ProofZKLocationProximity(userLocationCoordinates []float64, serviceLocationCoordinates []float64, proximityThreshold float64, locationProof []byte) (proof []byte, isInProximity bool, err error):**
     - Summary: Zero-knowledge location proximity proof. A user can prove they are within a certain proximity of a service location without revealing their exact location coordinates. 'locationProof' could involve techniques like geohashing and range proofs on geohash prefixes.

     - Functionality:  Provides a cryptographic hash function.

   * **CurvePointAddition(point1 []byte, point2 []byte) ([]byte, error):**
     - Summary:  Performs elliptic curve point addition operation, essential for many ZKP primitives (assuming elliptic curve cryptography is used as the underlying group).
     - Functionality:  Elliptic curve point addition.

   * **ScalarMultiplication(scalar []byte, point []byte) ([]byte, error):**
     - Summary:  Performs scalar multiplication on an elliptic curve point, another fundamental operation for elliptic curve-based ZKP.
     - Functionality: Elliptic curve scalar multiplication.

   * **SerializeProof(proofData interface{}) ([]byte, error):**
     - Summary:  Serializes ZKP proof data into a byte array for storage or transmission.
     - Functionality:  Proof serialization.

   * **DeserializeProof(proofBytes []byte, proofData interface{}) error:**

     - Functionality: Proof deserialization.

   * **VerifyProof(proof []byte, publicParameters interface{}) (bool, error):**
     - Summary:  A generic verification function that takes a proof and public parameters and returns whether the proof is valid. This would be a dispatcher function internally calling the specific verification logic for each proof type.
     - Functionality:  Generic proof verification entry point.

**Note:**

* This is an outline and function summary. Actual implementation would require choosing specific cryptographic libraries for elliptic curve operations, hash functions, etc., and rigorously implementing the ZKP protocols.
* Error handling is simplified in the summaries for clarity. Real implementations should have robust error handling.
* The `[]byte` type for cryptographic data is used for generality. In practice, specific types might be used based on the chosen crypto library (e.g., elliptic curve point types).
* The "trendy" aspect is reflected in functions related to DeFi (loan eligibility, private auctions), privacy-preserving data aggregation, and location-based services, which are current areas of interest in ZKP research and applications.
* This library aims to be more than a demonstration; it provides a set of tools to build practical ZKP-enabled applications. It is designed to be modular so that new ZKP protocols and application-specific functions can be added.
* This is not a duplication of existing open-source libraries as it focuses on a specific set of advanced and application-oriented ZKP functionalities, rather than being a general-purpose cryptographic library.  It's intended to be a higher-level library that *uses* lower-level crypto libraries.
