// # Zero-Knowledge Proof Library in Go: Private Set Intersection Proof for Machine Learning Feature Sets

// # Function Summary:

// ## Setup Functions:
// 1. `GenerateZKParameters()`: Generates global parameters for the ZKP system (e.g., group, generators).
// 2. `GenerateFeatureSet(size int)`: Generates a random feature set (simulating machine learning features).
// 3. `HashFeatureSet(featureSet []string)`: Hashes each feature in a set to a numerical representation.

// ## Commitment Functions:
// 4. `CommitFeatureSet(hashedFeatureSet []*big.Int, params *ZKParameters)`: Prover commits to their hashed feature set using Pedersen Commitment.
// 5. `CommitFeature(hashedFeature *big.Int, params *ZKParameters)`: Prover commits to a single hashed feature.

// ## Proof Generation Functions:
// 6. `GeneratePSIProof(proverHashedSet []*big.Int, receiverCommittedSet []*Commitment, params *ZKParameters)`: Prover generates a Zero-Knowledge Proof of Private Set Intersection (PSI) against the receiver's committed set.

// 8. `GenerateNonMembershipProof(hashedFeature *big.Int, committedSet []*Commitment, params *ZKParameters)`: Prover generates a proof that a specific hashed feature is *not* a member of the receiver's committed set.
// 9. `GenerateSetSizeProof(hashedFeatureSet []*big.Int, params *ZKParameters)`: Prover generates a ZKP to prove the size of their feature set without revealing the features themselves.
// 10. `GenerateSubsetProof(proverHashedSet []*big.Int, receiverCommittedSet []*Commitment, params *ZKParameters)`: Prover generates a ZKP to prove their hashed feature set is a subset of the receiver's committed feature set.
// 11. `GenerateDisjointSetProof(proverHashedSet []*big.Int, receiverCommittedSet []*Commitment, params *ZKParameters)`: Prover generates a ZKP to prove their hashed feature set is disjoint from the receiver's committed feature set (no intersection).

// ## Verification Functions:
// 12. `VerifyPSIProof(proof *PSIProof, receiverCommittedSet []*Commitment, proverCommitment *SetCommitment, params *ZKParameters)`: Verifies the Zero-Knowledge Proof of Private Set Intersection.
// 13. `VerifySetMembershipProof(proof *MembershipProof, committedSet []*Commitment, commitment *Commitment, params *ZKParameters)`: Verifies the Set Membership Proof.
// 14. `VerifyNonMembershipProof(proof *NonMembershipProof, committedSet []*Commitment, commitment *Commitment, params *ZKParameters)`: Verifies the Non-Membership Proof.
// 15. `VerifySetSizeProof(proof *SetSizeProof, proverCommitment *SetCommitment, params *ZKParameters)`: Verifies the Set Size Proof.
// 16. `VerifySubsetProof(proof *SubsetProof, receiverCommittedSet []*Commitment, proverCommitment *SetCommitment, params *ZKParameters)`: Verifies the Subset Proof.

// ## Utility Functions:
// 18. `GenerateRandomScalar(params *ZKParameters)`: Generates a random scalar modulo group order.
// 19. `ScalarMultiply(base *Point, scalar *big.Int, params *ZKParameters)`: Performs scalar multiplication on elliptic curve points.
// 20. `PointAdd(p1 *Point, p2 *Point, params *ZKParameters)`: Performs point addition on elliptic curve points.
// 21. `HashToGroup(data []byte, params *ZKParameters)`: Hashes arbitrary data to a point on the elliptic curve group. (Optional, for more advanced hashing)
// 22. `AreCommitmentsWellFormed(commitments []*Commitment, params *ZKParameters)`: Checks if a list of commitments are well-formed (e.g., on the curve).

// # Advanced Concept: Private Set Intersection (PSI) Proof for Machine Learning Feature Sets

// This library focuses on demonstrating Zero-Knowledge Proofs for operations related to sets,
// specifically in the context of machine learning feature sets. The core concept is to enable
// privacy-preserving feature set comparison and analysis.

// Imagine two parties (Prover and Verifier/Receiver) involved in a collaborative machine learning scenario.
// The Prover has a set of features extracted from their data, and the Receiver has a (possibly different)
// set of features, or wants to check properties of the Prover's feature set without learning the features themselves.

// This library provides functions to perform Zero-Knowledge Proofs for:
// 1. **Private Set Intersection (PSI) Proof:**  The Prover can prove to the Receiver that their feature set
//    has a non-empty intersection with a set that the Receiver has committed to, without revealing
//    the actual intersection or the full feature sets. This is useful for scenarios where parties want
//    to collaborate only if they have some common features, but don't want to expose their entire feature space.
// 2. **Set Membership Proof:** The Prover can prove that a specific feature (in hashed form) is part of the
//    Receiver's committed feature set without revealing which feature it is.
// 3. **Set Non-Membership Proof:**  The Prover can prove that a specific feature is *not* part of the Receiver's
//    committed feature set.
// 4. **Set Size Proof:** The Prover can prove the size of their feature set without revealing the features themselves.
// 5. **Subset Proof:** The Prover can prove that their feature set is a subset of the Receiver's committed set.
// 6. **Disjoint Set Proof:** The Prover can prove that their feature set is disjoint from the Receiver's committed set.

// These functions leverage cryptographic commitments and zero-knowledge proof techniques to achieve
// privacy while enabling verifiable computations on feature sets. This is particularly relevant in
// federated learning, secure multi-party computation for machine learning, and data privacy applications.

// **Important Notes:**
// - This code provides an outline and conceptual framework. It's not a fully implemented, secure, or efficient ZKP library.
// - Cryptographic primitives (elliptic curve operations, hashing, etc.) are represented by placeholder functions.
// - For a real-world implementation, you would need to use a robust cryptographic library (e.g., `go-ethereum/crypto`, `gnark-crypto`)
//   and implement the cryptographic details of the ZKP protocols (e.g., Sigma protocols, zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs) correctly.
// - The PSI proof, set membership, and other proofs are based on general ZKP principles and would require
//   specific protocol design and implementation using cryptographic techniques.
// - This example uses Pedersen Commitment scheme for simplicity. More advanced commitment schemes might be needed
//   for stronger security or efficiency in real-world applications.
// - Efficiency and security are critical aspects of ZKP implementations and require careful design and analysis.
