	// This might resemble a Sigma protocol (response = secret * challenge + randomness),
	// but is applied here in a non-standard way to fit the R1CS context conceptually.
	// Let's create a dummy 'response' polynomial and commit to it.
	// A real SNARK uses evaluation proofs.
	responseValue := witnessSum.Mul(challenge).Add(blindingFE) // Dummy response logic
	responsePoly := NewPolynomial([]FieldElement{responseValue}, setup.Prime)
	// Commit to the response? Or is the response itself an opening? Let's make responses openings.
	// A real ZKP uses opening proofs for committed polynomials. The 'response' is part of that opening.
	// We'll return the dummy commitment and the dummy response value.
	// The response value itself is NOT typically sent directly like this in a secure SNARK.

	// Final Proof Structure (Conceptual):
	// Commitments: [WitnessCommitment]
	// Responses: [DummyResponseValue based on challenge]
	// This is drastically different from a real ZKP proof structure.

	// Let's refine the concept slightly closer to an opening proof:
	// Prover commits to polynomial P(x). Verifier sends challenge 'r'. Prover sends P(r) and an opening proof.
	// Our simplified R1CS proof could conceptually commit to polynomials related to the witness,
	// get a challenge 'z', evaluate the witness polynomials at 'z', and provide "responses"
	// that are related to these evaluations and the challenges.

	// A better conceptual approach for R1CS satisfaction (closer to Pinocchio/Groth16 idea):
	// Prover builds polynomials representing A(x), B(x), C(x) where A(x)_i = Sum(A_ij * x^j), etc.
	// Or polynomials representing A_eval(w), B_eval(w), C_eval(w) where w is the witness vector.
	// Let's conceptualize polynomials over the evaluation points of the witness vectors for constraints.
	// W_A(x) = Sum(A_i * x^i), W_B(x) = Sum(B_i * x^i), W_C(x) = Sum(C_i * x^i), where A_i is the i-th row of A multiplied by witness.
	// This is not quite right. Let's stick to the core R1CS check: A * B = C.
	// A real ZKP for R1CS involves polynomials whose roots represent the constraints.
	// E.g., Q(x) * Z(x) = A_poly(x)*B_poly(x) - C_poly(x) for all evaluation points.
	// Let's simplify: Prover commits to the witness polynomial W(x) where W(i) = witness[i] for i=0..numVars-1.
	// Prover also commits to polynomials representing A, B, C matrices applied to the witness.
	// Let W_A = A * witness, W_B = B * witness, W_C = C * witness (vectors).
	// The check is W_A_i * W_B_i = W_C_i for each constraint i.
	// Prover commits to polynomials P_A(x), P_B(x), P_C(x) where P_A(i) = W_A[i], etc.
