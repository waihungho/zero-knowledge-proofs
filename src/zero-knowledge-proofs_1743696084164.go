Outline and Function Summary:

Package zkp_playground provides a collection of functions demonstrating various Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) concepts.
These functions are designed to be illustrative and explore different advanced and trendy applications of ZKPs,
going beyond basic examples and avoiding duplication of existing open-source implementations.

Function Summary:

1. CommitAndReveal(secret string) (commitment string, reveal func() string):
   - Demonstrates a simple commitment scheme. The prover commits to a secret without revealing it,
     and can later reveal it, allowing the verifier to check consistency.

2. ChallengeResponseAuth(secret string, challenge string, response string) bool:
   - Implements a basic challenge-response authentication using ZKP principles.
     The prover proves knowledge of a secret by correctly responding to a challenge without revealing the secret itself.

3. NonInteractiveProofOfKnowledge(witness string, statement string) (proof string):
   - Generates a non-interactive proof of knowledge of a witness related to a public statement.
     Uses a simplified Fiat-Shamir heuristic for non-interactivity.

4. VerifyNonInteractiveProofOfKnowledge(proof string, statement string) bool:
   - Verifies a non-interactive proof of knowledge against a public statement.

5. RangeProof(value int, min int, max int) (proof string):
   - Creates a proof that a given value is within a specified range [min, max] without revealing the value itself.
     (Simplified demonstration, not cryptographically secure range proof).

6. VerifyRangeProof(proof string, min int, max int) bool:
   - Verifies the range proof, confirming that the value is indeed within the given range without revealing the value.

7. SetMembershipProof(element string, set []string) (proof string):
   - Generates a proof that an element is a member of a given set without revealing the element or other elements in the set (beyond membership).

8. VerifySetMembershipProof(proof string, set []string) bool:
   - Verifies the set membership proof, confirming the element's presence in the set.

9. PrivateDataAggregation(data1 map[string]int, data2 map[string]int) (proof string, aggregatedResult map[string]int):
   - Demonstrates private data aggregation. Two parties can compute an aggregate result (e.g., sum of shared keys' values)
     without revealing their individual datasets to each other. Proof verifies the aggregation is correct. (Simplified).

10. VerifyPrivateDataAggregation(proof string, aggregatedResult map[string]int, publicInfo string) bool:
    - Verifies the proof of private data aggregation, ensuring the aggregated result is correct based on public information.

11. ConditionalDisclosure(secret string, condition bool) (proof string, revealedSecret string):
    - Implements conditional disclosure. The secret is revealed only if a certain condition is met, along with a proof that the condition was checked correctly.

12. VerifyConditionalDisclosure(proof string, revealedSecret string, condition bool) bool:
    - Verifies the proof of conditional disclosure, ensuring the secret was revealed only if the condition was true.

13. ZeroKnowledgeShuffle(inputList []string) (proof string, shuffledList []string):
    - Demonstrates a zero-knowledge shuffle. The input list is shuffled, and a proof is generated that the output is a valid shuffle of the input, without revealing the shuffling permutation. (Simplified concept).

14. VerifyZeroKnowledgeShuffle(proof string, originalList []string, shuffledList []string) bool:
    - Verifies the zero-knowledge shuffle proof, confirming that the shuffled list is indeed a valid permutation of the original list.

15. ProofOfComputation(input int, expectedOutput int) (proof string):
    - Creates a proof that a computation (e.g., a simple function) was executed correctly for a given input and produced the expected output, without revealing the computation itself.

16. VerifyProofOfComputation(proof string, input int, expectedOutput int) bool:
    - Verifies the proof of computation, ensuring the computation was performed correctly.

17. ZeroKnowledgeAuction(bidderSecret string, bidValue int, auctionPublicKey string) (proof string, encryptedBid string):
    - Demonstrates a simplified zero-knowledge auction bid. A bidder encrypts their bid and generates a proof that the encrypted bid corresponds to the claimed bid value, without revealing the bid value in plaintext. (Conceptual).

18. VerifyZeroKnowledgeAuctionBid(proof string, encryptedBid string, auctionPublicKey string) bool:
    - Verifies the zero-knowledge auction bid proof, ensuring the encrypted bid is valid and associated with a legitimate bid.

19. ProofOfNoNegativeInformation(claim string, evidence string) (proof string):
    - Demonstrates a proof of no negative information. Proves that a certain claim cannot be disproven by given evidence, essentially showing consistency without revealing the underlying details of the evidence or claim.

20. VerifyProofOfNoNegativeInformation(proof string, claim string, evidence string) bool:
    - Verifies the proof of no negative information, confirming the consistency claim based on the evidence.

21. AttributeBasedAccessProof(userAttributes map[string]string, requiredAttributes map[string]string) (proof string):
    - Demonstrates attribute-based access proof. Proves that a user possesses a certain set of attributes that satisfy access requirements, without revealing the exact attribute values beyond what's necessary for verification.

22. VerifyAttributeBasedAccessProof(proof string, requiredAttributes map[string]string) bool:
    - Verifies the attribute-based access proof, ensuring the user satisfies the required attribute criteria.

Note: These functions are simplified for demonstration and educational purposes. They do not use cryptographically secure primitives and are not intended for production use. Real-world ZKP implementations require robust cryptographic libraries and rigorous security analysis.
