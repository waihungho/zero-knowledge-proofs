# Zero-Knowledge Proof Functions in Go

## Outline and Function Summary:

This code outlines a Go implementation of various Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) functions, exploring advanced and trendy concepts beyond basic demonstrations.  It avoids duplication of open-source libraries and focuses on creative applications.

**Categories:**

1.  **Basic ZKP Primitives (Foundation):**
    *   `ZKP_EqualityOfHashes(secret, hash)`: Proves knowledge of a secret that hashes to a given value without revealing the secret. (Classic ZKP)
    *   `ZKP_RangeProof(value, min, max)`: Proves a value is within a specified range without revealing the value itself. (Essential for many privacy applications)
    *   `ZKP_MembershipProof(element, commitmentSet)`: Proves an element is a member of a committed set without revealing the element or the entire set. (For anonymous set membership)

2.  **Advanced Data Privacy and Computation:**
    *   `ZKP_PrivateDataComparison(data1, data2, comparisonType)`: Proves a relationship (e.g., equality, greater than) between two private datasets without revealing the datasets. (For secure multi-party computation)
    *   `ZKP_PrivateSetIntersection(set1Commitment, set2Commitment)`: Proves that two privately committed sets have a non-empty intersection without revealing the sets themselves. (Privacy-preserving data analysis)
    *   `ZKP_PrivateSumAggregation(dataCommitments)`: Proves the sum of privately committed data values is within a certain range or equal to a known value, without revealing individual values. (Federated learning, secure statistics)
    *   `ZKP_PrivateFunctionEvaluation(inputCommitment, functionCommitment, expectedOutputCommitment)`: Proves that a specific function applied to a private input results in a specific private output, without revealing input, function, or output directly. (Homomorphic encryption applications)
    *   `ZKP_MachineLearningModelIntegrity(modelHash, trainingDataHash)`: Proves that a machine learning model was trained on specific (hashed) training data without revealing the model or data. (Verifiable AI)

3.  **Anonymous and Credential Systems:**
    *   `ZKP_AnonymousCredentialIssuance(attributes, issuerPublicKey)`: Allows a user to obtain an anonymous credential based on their attributes from an issuer, without revealing the attributes to the issuer in the credential itself. (Anonymous digital identity)
    *   `ZKP_AnonymousCredentialVerification(credential, requiredAttributes)`: Allows a verifier to check if an anonymous credential possesses certain required attributes without linking the credential to the user's identity or revealing other attributes. (Selective attribute disclosure)
    *   `ZKP_ReputationScoreProof(reputationCommitment, threshold)`: Proves a user's reputation score (represented by a commitment) is above a certain threshold without revealing the exact score. (Privacy-preserving reputation systems)
    *   `ZKP_AnonymousVotingEligibility(voterIDCommitment, eligibilityListCommitment)`: Proves a voter is eligible to vote based on a committed eligibility list without revealing their identity or the full eligibility list. (Secure and anonymous voting)

4.  **Blockchain and Distributed Systems:**
    *   `ZKP_TransactionValidityWithoutDetails(transactionCommitment, blockchainStateCommitment)`: Proves a transaction is valid according to the current blockchain state without revealing the transaction details. (Privacy-preserving blockchains)
    *   `ZKP_CrossChainAssetTransferProof(sourceChainStateProof, destinationChainStateCommitment)`: Proves that an asset transfer across blockchains is valid without revealing the full details of the transfer. (Interoperable blockchains)
    *   `ZKP_SecureMultiPartyComputationResultVerification(computationInputsCommitments, resultCommitment, computationHash)`: Proves the result of a secure multi-party computation is correct without revealing the inputs or intermediate steps. (Verifiable MPC)
    *   `ZKP_DecentralizedIdentityAttributeProof(identityCommitment, attributeQuery, attributeValueCommitment)`: Proves a decentralized identity possesses a specific attribute with a certain committed value without revealing the full identity or other attributes. (Self-sovereign identity)

5.  **Emerging and Creative ZKP Applications:**
    *   `ZKP_GraphPropertyProof(graphCommitment, propertyType)`: Proves a graph (represented by a commitment) possesses a certain property (e.g., connectivity, planarity) without revealing the graph structure. (Graph privacy)
    *   `ZKP_AIModelExplainabilityProof(modelInput, modelOutput, explanationCommitment)`: Proves an AI model's output for a given input is consistent with a provided (committed) explanation, without revealing the full model or explanation details. (Verifiable and explainable AI)
    *   `ZKP_QuantumResistanceProof(data, proofAlgorithm)`: Demonstrates a proof of a statement using a quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithm in a ZKP framework. (Future-proof security)
    *   `ZKP_DynamicDataOwnershipProof(dataCommitment, ownershipHistoryCommitment, currentOwner)`: Proves current ownership of a piece of dynamic data by verifying a history of ownership changes, without revealing the full data or ownership history. (Data provenance and control)

**Note:** This is an outline. Actual implementation would require choosing specific cryptographic primitives (like Schnorr, zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs, etc.) and libraries for each function based on performance and security requirements. The `// TODO: Implement ZKP logic here` comments indicate where the core ZKP algorithms would be implemented.
