// ZKP Conceptual Implementation Outline:
//
// This code provides a conceptual framework and defines interfaces/functions
// for various advanced, creative, and trendy Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)
// applications in Golang. It does *not* implement the underlying complex
// cryptographic primitives (like polynomial commitments, pairing-based
// cryptography, elliptic curves, circuit compilers, etc.) from scratch.
// Implementing a secure and efficient ZKP scheme requires a deep
// understanding of advanced cryptography and is a significant undertaking,
// typically relying on established libraries like gnark, arkworks, etc.
//
// The purpose here is to showcase the *types* of problems ZKP can solve,
// demonstrating the API and data flow (Statement, Witness, Proof) for
// diverse use cases, adhering to the constraint of not duplicating existing
// open-source *implementations* of the crypto core.
//
// Structures:
// - Statement: Represents the public data or claim being proven.
// - Witness: Represents the private data known only to the prover.
// - Proof: Represents the zero-knowledge proof generated by the prover.
// - Prover: Represents the entity generating the proof.
// - Verifier: Represents the entity verifying the proof.
//
// Key Concepts Demonstrated (via function names and descriptions):
// - Proving knowledge of data without revealing the data.
// - Proving properties about data without revealing the data.
// - Proving execution integrity of computation.
// - Enabling privacy-preserving operations.
// - Enabling verifiable computation and scaling.
// - Handling complex data structures and relationships privately.
