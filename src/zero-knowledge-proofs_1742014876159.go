// # Zero-Knowledge Proof in Golang: Secure Anonymous Data Aggregation for Average Calculation

// # Outline and Function Summary:

// ## 1. Setup Functions:
//    * GenerateRandomValue(): Generates a cryptographically secure random big integer for secret values.
//    * GenerateCommitmentKey(): Generates a random key used for commitment schemes.
//    * GenerateProofRandomness(): Generates random values used in proof generation to ensure non-reproducibility.
//    * InitializeAggregationParameters(): Sets up global parameters like range boundaries for data values.
//    * CreateParticipantID(): Generates a unique identifier for each participant in the aggregation.

// ## 2. Prover Functions (Participant Side):
//    * CommitToValue(): Creates a commitment to a participant's secret data value using a commitment key.
//    * GenerateRangeProof(): Generates a zero-knowledge proof that the committed value lies within a predefined range, without revealing the value.
//    * GenerateKnowledgeOfCommitmentProof(): Proves knowledge of the value corresponding to a commitment without revealing the value.
//    * GenerateContributionProof(): Combines the range proof and commitment knowledge proof into a single proof for data contribution.
//    * AnonymizeParticipantData():  Transforms participant's data into an anonymized form before commitment, like adding random noise within a known range.

// ## 3. Verifier Functions (Aggregator Side):
//    * VerifyCommitment(): Checks if a commitment is validly formed. (Basic check, might be implicit in other functions)
//    * VerifyRangeProof(): Verifies the zero-knowledge range proof to ensure the committed value is within the allowed range.
//    * VerifyKnowledgeOfCommitmentProof(): Verifies the proof of knowledge of the committed value.
//    * VerifyContributionProof(): Verifies the combined proof to ensure both range and knowledge are proven.
//    * ValidateParticipantID(): Checks if a participant ID is in a valid format or from a recognized source.

// ## 4. Aggregation & Result Functions:
//    * AggregateCommitments(): Collects and aggregates commitments from all participants. (Conceptual, aggregation might happen implicitly depending on commitment scheme)
//    * AggregateProofs(): Collects all contribution proofs from participants. (For logging or batch verification, might not be strictly necessary for aggregation itself in some schemes)
//    * VerifyAllProofs(): Verifies all collected proofs in batch or sequentially.
//    * ComputeAnonymousAverage(): Computes the average of the secret values based on the aggregated commitments and verified proofs, without knowing individual values. (This is the core goal, the "average" calculation itself is simple once commitments/proofs are processed conceptually).
//    * FinalizeAggregationResult():  Presents the final anonymous average and related verification statistics.

// ## 5. Utility Functions:
//    * SerializeProof(): Converts proof data structures into a serializable format (e.g., byte array).
//    * DeserializeProof(): Reconstructs proof data structures from a serialized format.
//    * HashCommitment():  Hashes a commitment for secure storage or transmission.
//    * CompareCommitments():  Compares two commitments for equality (if needed).

// Note: This is a conceptual outline and simplified example. Actual ZKP implementations would involve more complex cryptographic primitives and protocols like zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs, etc. for efficiency and security in real-world applications. This example focuses on demonstrating the *idea* of ZKP for a specific use case.  "Range Proof" and "Knowledge of Commitment Proof" are simplified placeholders for more sophisticated ZKP techniques.

**Explanation and Advanced Concepts Demonstrated (Beyond Simple Demonstration):**

1.  **Anonymous Data Aggregation:** The core function is to calculate an anonymous average. This is a practical and trendy application of ZKP in data privacy, useful for surveys, sensor data aggregation, and more, where you want to compute statistics without revealing individual contributions.

2.  **Commitment Scheme (Simplified):**  The `CommitToValue` function represents a simplified commitment scheme.  In a real ZKP system, commitments are cryptographically designed to be:
    *   **Binding:** The prover cannot change their mind about the committed value after making the commitment.
    *   **Hiding:** The commitment reveals nothing about the value itself.
    This example uses a simple hash which is binding but not truly hiding in a strong cryptographic sense. Real ZKP systems use more robust commitment methods (e.g., Pedersen commitments).

3.  **Range Proof (Placeholder):** `GenerateRangeProof` and `VerifyRangeProof` functions are placeholders for a *Zero-Knowledge Range Proof*.  The core idea is to prove that a committed value lies within a specific range (e.g., 0-100 for valid data values) *without revealing the actual value*. This is crucial for data validation in anonymous systems.  Real range proofs are complex cryptographic constructs (like Bulletproofs) that achieve zero-knowledge and efficiency.

4.  **Proof of Knowledge (Placeholder):** `GenerateKnowledgeOfCommitmentProof` and `VerifyKnowledgeOfCommitmentProof` are placeholders for proving *knowledge of the committed value*.  This ensures that the prover actually knows the value they committed to and didn't just create a random commitment.

5.  **Combined Contribution Proof:** `GenerateContributionProof` and `VerifyContributionProof` combine the range proof and knowledge proof. This is a step towards building more complex ZKP protocols where multiple properties of the secret data are proven simultaneously.

6.  **Anonymization (Placeholder):** `AnonymizeParticipantData` is included to represent a stage where data is anonymized *before* applying ZKP. In a real system, this could involve techniques like differential privacy to add noise to the data to further protect individual privacy while still allowing for meaningful aggregation.

7.  **Aggregation and Verification:** The `AggregateCommitments`, `AggregateProofs`, and `VerifyAllProofs` functions demonstrate the aggregator's role in collecting commitments and proofs from multiple participants and then verifying all the proofs to ensure data integrity and validity before computing the final result.

8.  **Conceptual Anonymous Average:**  `ComputeAnonymousAverage` highlights the goal of calculating an average anonymously.  **Crucially, it emphasizes that the simplified hash-based commitment in this example *cannot* actually compute the average.**  Real ZKP systems for anonymous average calculation would use *homomorphic encryption* or specialized ZKP protocols that allow computation on encrypted/committed data.

9.  **Modular Structure:** The code is organized into logical sections (Setup, Prover, Verifier, Aggregation, Utility) to reflect the typical stages of a ZKP protocol and make it easier to understand and extend.

10. **20+ Functions:** The code includes more than 20 functions, each serving a distinct purpose in the ZKP workflow, fulfilling the requirement of the prompt.

**Important Caveats (for Real-World ZKP):**

*   **Security:** The cryptographic primitives used in this example are **extremely simplified and insecure** for demonstration purposes.  **Do not use this code in any production system.** Real ZKP implementations require carefully designed and cryptographically reviewed algorithms and libraries (like Bulletproofs, zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, etc.).
*   **Efficiency:** Real ZKP systems often need to be highly efficient, especially for large-scale applications. This simplified example does not address efficiency considerations.
*   **Complexity:**  True ZKP cryptography is mathematically complex. This example simplifies many concepts to make them understandable in code.

**To build a real-world secure and efficient ZKP system, you would need to:**

*   Use established cryptographic libraries and algorithms for ZKP (e.g., using libraries that implement Bulletproofs, zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, etc.).
*   Carefully design the ZKP protocol to match the specific security and privacy requirements of your application.
*   Consider performance and scalability aspects.
*   Have your design and implementation reviewed by cryptography experts.
