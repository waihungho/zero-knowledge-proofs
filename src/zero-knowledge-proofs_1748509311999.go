Okay, building a production-ready, cryptographically secure Zero-Knowledge Proof system from scratch with 20+ distinct, advanced functionalities in a single response is practically impossible. Real ZKP systems involve complex mathematics (elliptic curves, finite fields, polynomial commitments, etc.) and are built over years by teams using sophisticated libraries.

The constraint "don't duplicate any of open source" is particularly challenging because most *functional* ZKP code *is* open source and relies on common cryptographic primitives.

Therefore, this response will provide a **conceptual framework** in Golang. It will structure the code to *represent* how a ZKP system *could* work for various advanced scenarios. The core ZKP logic (`GenerateProof`, `VerifyProof`) will be highly simplified, using placeholder functions for cryptographic operations, rather than implementing complex schemes like zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs from the ground up.

This allows us to showcase the *structure* and the *types of problems* ZKPs can solve in interesting ways, fulfilling the "20+ functions" and "advanced/creative/trendy" requirements without building a non-trivial, secure cryptographic library within this response. Each "function" will essentially be a different `Statement` type the system can handle.

**Disclaimer:** This code is **not suitable for production use**. It omits essential cryptographic complexity and security considerations necessary for real-world ZKPs. It is designed purely to illustrate the *concepts* and *structure* for a variety of advanced ZKP use cases.
