/*
Outline and Function Summary:

This Go package, `zkp`, provides a conceptual framework for demonstrating Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) applications.
It focuses on showcasing diverse and advanced use cases of ZKP beyond basic examples, without implementing actual cryptographic protocols.
This is a conceptual demonstration of function ideas, not a production-ready ZKP library.  Real-world ZKP implementations require robust cryptographic libraries and rigorous security audits.

Function Summary (20+ functions):

Category: Basic Proofs & Set Membership

1.  ProveSetMembership(element, set, witness):  Proves that an element belongs to a set without revealing the element itself or the entire set.  Useful for anonymous authentication or private data queries.

2.  ProveRange(value, min, max, witness):  Proves that a value falls within a specified range without revealing the exact value.  Applicable in age verification, credit score checks, or resource limits.

3.  ProveNonMembership(element, set, witness):  Proves that an element *does not* belong to a set, without revealing the element or the set directly.  Useful for blacklisting or exclusion proofs.

4.  ProveSubset(subset, superset, witness): Proves that one set is a subset of another, without revealing the elements of either set.  Useful for access control based on group memberships.

Category: Data Privacy & Analysis

5.  ProveAverageInRange(dataset, minAverage, maxAverage, witness): Proves that the average of a dataset falls within a given range without revealing the individual data points. For privacy-preserving statistical analysis.

6.  ProveVarianceBelowThreshold(dataset, threshold, witness):  Proves that the variance of a dataset is below a certain threshold, without disclosing the data itself. Useful for quality control or risk assessment on private data.

7.  ProveDataProvenance(dataHash, provenanceChain, witness): Proves the origin and integrity of data by demonstrating a valid chain of provenance (e.g., digital signature chain) without revealing the entire provenance chain structure.  For verifiable data integrity.

8.  ProveEncryptedDataProperty(encryptedData, decryptionKeyProof, propertyProof):  Proves a property about encrypted data without decrypting it.  This is a more advanced concept, showing the possibility of computation on encrypted data using ZKP. (Conceptual illustration)

Category: Secure Computation & Logic

9.  ProveFunctionEvaluation(input, output, functionCodeHash, executionProof):  Proves that a specific function, identified by its hash, was correctly evaluated for a given input and output, without revealing the function code itself.  For verifiable computation in untrusted environments.

10. ProveLogicalStatement(statement, truthAssignment, proof):  Proves the truth of a complex logical statement (e.g., propositional logic, predicate logic) without revealing the truth assignment that makes it true.  For secure multi-party computation or policy enforcement.

11. ProveConditionalExecution(condition, programHash, input, outputIfTrue, outputIfFalse, conditionWitness, executionWitness): Proves that a program was executed conditionally based on a hidden condition, and provides the correct output based on whether the condition was true or false (without revealing the condition itself). For private conditional logic.

Category: Identity & Attributes

12. ProveAgeRange(birthdate, minAge, maxAge, witness): Proves that a person's age falls within a specific range based on their birthdate, without revealing the exact birthdate. For age verification while preserving privacy.

13. ProveLocationProximity(locationData, referenceLocation, proximityThreshold, witness): Proves that a person's location is within a certain proximity of a reference location without revealing their exact location. For location-based services with privacy.

14. ProveSkillVerification(skillsList, requiredSkill, credentialProof): Proves that a person possesses a specific skill from a list of skills, without revealing all their skills or the underlying credentials. For privacy-preserving skill-based access control.

15. ProveReputationThreshold(reputationScore, threshold, reputationProof): Proves that a user's reputation score is above a certain threshold without revealing the exact score. For reputation-based access or filtering.

Category: Advanced & Creative ZKP Applications

16. ProveFairnessInAuction(bid, winningBidProof, otherBidsHash, auctionRulesHash): In a sealed-bid auction, proves that a bid was placed fairly and that the winning bid was determined according to predefined auction rules, without revealing the actual bids of others (except potentially the winning bid in a specific ZKP scheme designed for this). For verifiable fair auctions.

17. ProveRandomnessVerifiability(randomValue, commitment, randomnessProof): Proves that a generated random value was indeed randomly generated and corresponds to a previously published commitment, without revealing the random value prematurely. For verifiable randomness in distributed systems or lotteries.

18. ProveModelCorrectness(machineLearningModel, inputDataHash, outputPredictionHash, modelIntegrityProof): Proves that a machine learning model (identified by hash) produces a specific output for a given input (identified by hash) and that the model itself is intact and hasn't been tampered with. For verifiable AI model deployments.

19. ProveResourceAvailability(resourceType, requiredAmount, availabilityProof): Proves that a certain amount of a resource (e.g., compute power, storage, bandwidth) is available without revealing the total resource capacity or utilization. For resource negotiation in distributed systems.

20. ProveKnowledgeOfSolutionToPuzzle(puzzleHash, solutionProof): Proves knowledge of the solution to a computationally hard puzzle (identified by its hash) without revealing the solution itself. For secure authentication challenges or proof-of-work systems.

21. ProveDataIntegrityOverTime(dataHashChain, timestamp, integrityProof): Proves the integrity of data at a specific point in time by referencing a chain of data hashes (like a blockchain concept) without revealing the entire chain or the data itself. For verifiable data archiving and historical integrity.

These functions are designed to be illustrative and conceptually demonstrate the power and versatility of Zero-Knowledge Proofs in various advanced and trendy applications.  Remember, this is a conceptual outline and would require significant cryptographic implementation for real-world use.
