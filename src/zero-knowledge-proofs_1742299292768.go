Outline and Function Summary:

Package `zkp` provides a conceptual demonstration of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) in Go, focusing on a trendy and advanced application: **Decentralized Anonymous Reputation System**.

This system allows users to prove various aspects of their reputation without revealing their actual score or underlying data, preserving privacy while enabling trust in decentralized environments.

**Core Concept:**  Users have a "Reputation Score" which is a secret. They can generate ZKPs to prove certain statements about their reputation to verifiers *without revealing* the score itself.

**Functions (20+):**

**Reputation Score Proofs:**

1.  **ProveReputationScoreInRange(score int, min int, max int): (proof, error)** - Prove that the user's reputation score is within a specified range [min, max] without revealing the exact score.
2.  **ProveReputationScoreAboveThreshold(score int, threshold int): (proof, error)** - Prove that the user's reputation score is above a certain threshold without revealing the exact score.
3.  **ProveReputationScoreBelowThreshold(score int, threshold int): (proof, error)** - Prove that the user's reputation score is below a certain threshold without revealing the exact score.
4.  **ProveReputationScoreIsMultipleOf(score int, factor int): (proof, error)** - Prove that the user's reputation score is a multiple of a given factor, without revealing the score.
5.  **ProveReputationScoreIsPrime(score int): (proof, error)** - Prove that the user's reputation score is a prime number (conceptually complex ZKP, simplified here).
6.  **ProveReputationScoreIsEven(score int): (proof, error)** - Prove that the user's reputation score is an even number.
7.  **ProveReputationScoreIsOdd(score int): (proof, error)** - Prove that the user's reputation score is an odd number.

**Reputation History/Attribute Proofs (Beyond Score):**

8.  **ProvePositiveFeedbackCountAbove(feedbackCount int, threshold int): (proof, error)** - Prove that the user has received more than a certain number of positive feedback without revealing the exact count.
9.  **ProveNegativeFeedbackCountBelow(feedbackCount int, threshold int): (proof, error)** - Prove that the user has received less than a certain number of negative feedback without revealing the exact count.
10. **ProveConsecutivePositiveFeedbackDays(days int, requiredDays int): (proof, error)** - Prove that the user has received positive feedback for at least a certain number of consecutive days.
11. **ProveNoNegativeFeedbackLastNDays(days int, n int): (proof, error)** - Prove that the user has received no negative feedback in the last 'n' days.
12. **ProveReputationFromSpecificAuthority(score int, authorityID string, minScore int): (proof, error)** - Prove that the user's reputation score from a specific authority is above a minimum score without revealing the actual score from that authority.
13. **ProveReputationScoreChangeWithinRange(currentScore int, previousScore int, minChange int, maxChange int): (proof, error)** - Prove that the change in reputation score from previous to current is within a specific range.

**Conditional/Comparative Proofs:**

14. **ProveReputationScoreGreaterThanPeer(myScore int, peerScoreProof string): (proof, error)** -  (Conceptually advanced - requires ZKP aggregation/comparison) Prove that the user's reputation score is greater than another user's score *based on their ZKP*, without revealing either score directly. (Simplified idea).
15. **ProveReputationScoreEqualsOneOfSet(score int, validScores []int): (proof, error)** - Prove that the user's reputation score is one of a predefined set of valid scores, without revealing which one.
16. **ProveReputationScoreNotEqualsValue(score int, invalidScore int): (proof, error)** - Prove that the user's reputation score is *not* a specific value.

**System Interaction/Policy Proofs (Application Level ZKPs):**

17. **ProveComplianceWithReputationPolicy(score int, policyHash string): (proof, error)** - Prove that the user's reputation score satisfies a certain reputation policy (represented by its hash) without revealing the policy details or the score completely.  This could be for accessing a service.
18. **ProveEligibilityForServiceTier(score int, tierRequirements map[string]int): (proof, error)** - Prove that the user is eligible for a specific service tier based on reputation score requirements, without revealing the exact score or all tier requirements.
19. **ProveSufficientReputationForAction(score int, actionCost int): (proof, error)** - Prove that the user has sufficient reputation to perform an action with a certain "reputation cost," without revealing the exact score or cost necessarily.
20. **ProveReputationScoreExists(score int): (proof, error)** - A very basic proof, simply proving that a reputation score exists (not zero or null), without revealing its value.
21. **ProveReputationScoreNonNegative(score int): (proof, error)** - Prove that the reputation score is not negative, without revealing the exact positive value. (Could be considered distinct from above threshold).
22. **ProveReputationScoreIsConfidential(score int, verifierPublicKey string): (proof, error)** - (Conceptually advanced)  Prove something about the reputation score to a verifier *encrypted to their public key* within the ZKP, ensuring only they can understand the proof's implications after verification.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Conceptual Demonstration:** This code is a *conceptual* demonstration.  It *does not* implement actual cryptographic ZKP protocols.  Real ZKP implementations require complex mathematics and cryptography (like zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs, etc.).
*   **Simplified Proof Generation/Verification:** The `GenerateProof` and `VerifyProof` functions are placeholders.  In a real system, these would be replaced with ZKP algorithm implementations.
*   **Focus on Functionality:** The focus is on illustrating *what* ZKPs can *do* in a practical, trendy context, not on the cryptographic "how."
*   **No Duplication of Open Source (Intent):**  This example aims to be original in its *application* and combination of functions, even if the underlying ZKP *concepts* are well-known.  It's designed to be a unique demonstration scenario rather than a cryptographic library.

**Explanation and Advanced Concepts Demonstrated:**

1.  **Decentralized Anonymous Reputation System:** The core idea is to build trust in decentralized systems without revealing sensitive user data. Reputation is a key component of trust. ZKPs allow proving reputation attributes without compromising privacy.

2.  **Range Proofs, Threshold Proofs, Modulo Proofs:**  Functions like `ProveReputationScoreInRange`, `ProveReputationScoreAboveThreshold`, `ProveReputationScoreIsMultipleOf` showcase different types of constraints that can be proven about a secret value (the reputation score) without revealing the value itself.  These are fundamental building blocks in many ZKP applications.

3.  **Attribute-Based Proofs:** Functions like `ProvePositiveFeedbackCountAbove`, `ProveConsecutivePositiveFeedbackDays` extend the concept beyond a single score to more complex reputation attributes and history, showing the versatility of ZKPs.

4.  **Comparative Proofs (Conceptual):** `ProveReputationScoreGreaterThanPeer` hints at advanced ZKP concepts where you can compare secret values *without revealing them*.  Real implementations of such proofs are more complex and often involve techniques like range proofs and commitment schemes combined.

5.  **Policy and Conditional Access:** `ProveComplianceWithReputationPolicy` and `ProveEligibilityForServiceTier` demonstrate how ZKPs can be used for access control and policy enforcement in decentralized systems. Users can prove they meet certain criteria (defined in a policy) without revealing *why* they meet them or all the details of their data.

6.  **Application-Level ZKPs:** The functions are not just mathematical examples; they are designed to be relevant to a real-world application (reputation system). This shows how ZKPs can be integrated into systems to enhance privacy and trust.

7.  **Confidential Proofs (Conceptual):** `ProveReputationScoreIsConfidential` introduces the idea that ZKPs can be constructed to be understandable or actionable only by specific parties who have the necessary keys or information. This is crucial for secure and private communication in decentralized settings.

**To make this a *real* ZKP system:**

*   **Replace Placeholders with Cryptography:** The `GenerateProofPlaceholder` and `VerifyProofPlaceholder` functions need to be replaced with actual cryptographic ZKP algorithms. Libraries like `go-ethereum/crypto/zkp` (though focused on Ethereum context) or external ZKP libraries could be used as a starting point or for inspiration.
*   **Choose a ZKP Protocol:** Decide on a specific ZKP protocol (e.g., zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs) based on the desired properties (proof size, verification speed, setup requirements, etc.) and the complexity of the proofs you want to generate.
*   **Define Proof Structures:** Design the actual `Proof` struct to hold the cryptographic data required by the chosen ZKP protocol.
*   **Implement Proof Generation and Verification Algorithms:** Code the algorithms for generating and verifying proofs according to the chosen protocol, using cryptographic primitives and libraries.
*   **Consider Performance and Security:** Real ZKP implementations require careful consideration of performance (proof generation and verification times) and security (soundness and zero-knowledge properties).

This example provides a solid conceptual foundation and demonstrates the *potential* of Zero-Knowledge Proofs for building advanced, privacy-preserving decentralized systems.  Building a fully functional ZKP system is a significant cryptographic engineering task.
