This package provides outlines for these ZKP functions. Actual cryptographic implementation would require specific ZKP protocols
(like Schnorr, Sigma protocols, zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs, etc.) and careful cryptographic engineering.
These outlines are conceptual and meant to demonstrate the breadth of ZKP applications beyond basic examples.
