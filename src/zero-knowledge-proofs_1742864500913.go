**Explanation and Important Notes:**

1.  **Outline and Function Summary:** The code starts with a clear outline and summary of all 22 functions, as requested.

2.  **Conceptual and Simplified:**  **Crucially, it's important to understand that these ZKP functions are highly simplified and conceptual demonstrations.**  They are designed to illustrate the *idea* of each type of ZKP and how it *could* be used in a trendy application.

3.  **Not Production-Ready Cryptography:**  **This code is NOT intended for production use in real-world secure systems.**  Real ZKP implementations are significantly more complex, mathematically rigorous, and require the use of established cryptographic libraries and protocols.

4.  **Simplified Cryptographic Primitives:**
    *   **Hashing:**  Uses `sha256.Sum256` directly for hashing, which is okay for demonstration but in real ZKP, you might need more specific hash functions suitable for the underlying mathematical structures.
    *   **Randomness:** Uses `crypto/rand.Reader` for random number generation, which is good.
    *   **Modular Arithmetic:**  The `hashToScalar` and `randomScalar` functions use simplified modulo operations with a prime number close to 2<sup>256</sup>.  In actual ZKP, you would work within specific groups (like elliptic curve groups or multiplicative groups of finite fields) with well-defined group orders. The choice of the generator `g = 2` is also extremely simplified and insecure.

5.  **Functionality and "Trendiness":**
    *   The functions cover a range of "trendy" and advanced concepts: verifiable computation, data provenance, privacy-preserving statistics, machine learning model properties, smart contracts, anonymous voting, secure auctions, code integrity, location privacy, data availability, etc.
    *   They are designed to be *creative* by touching upon these modern application domains.

6.  **No Duplication of Open Source (Intent):**  The code is written from scratch as per the request to avoid duplication.  While the *concepts* are based on established ZKP principles, the specific implementation style and the chosen "trendy" functions are intended to be unique to this example.

7.  **Verification is Simplified:** The `Verify...` functions are generally very basic string matching or simple checks. In real ZKPs, verification involves complex mathematical equations and checks based on the chosen cryptographic protocol.

8.  **Focus on Demonstrating Concepts:** The primary goal of this code is to demonstrate the *breadth* of applications of ZKP and give a basic code structure for each type of proof. It's not meant to be a deep dive into the cryptographic mathematics or efficient implementation of ZKP protocols.

**To make this code more realistic (but still conceptual):**

*   **Use a Proper Cryptographic Library:**  Integrate with a Go cryptographic library like `go-ethereum/crypto/bn256` (for elliptic curve cryptography) or similar to work with actual groups and cryptographic operations.
*   **Implement Basic ZKP Protocols:**  For functions like `ProveKnowledgeOfSecretValue`, implement a slightly more formal Schnorr-like protocol with proper commitments, challenges, and responses based on group operations (instead of just hashing and simplified arithmetic).
*   **For Range Proofs, Set Membership, etc.:**  Research and implement very simplified versions of common ZKP techniques for these tasks (e.g., a basic range proof concept using commitments and comparisons, a simple set membership proof concept using hashing).
*   **Focus on One or Two Functions in Detail:** Instead of 22 very simplified functions, you could choose 2-3 functions and implement them with slightly more cryptographic rigor (while still keeping them conceptual and not fully production-ready).

Remember to always consult with cryptography experts and use well-vetted libraries for any real-world security applications of zero-knowledge proofs.
