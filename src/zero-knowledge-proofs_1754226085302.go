This project implements a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) system in Golang for **Verifiable Neural Network Inference on Private Data**. The goal is to prove that a neural network (specifically, a small feed-forward network with ReLU activations) was correctly applied to a private input, yielding a specific output, without revealing the private input data or the model's weights.

This implementation focuses on the *logical structure* and *application* of ZKP to a complex problem, rather than building a production-grade cryptographic library from scratch. To avoid duplicating existing open-source ZKP frameworks (like `gnark` or `bellman`), the deep cryptographic primitives (e.g., elliptic curve pairings, full polynomial commitment schemes like KZG) are *abstracted*. Instead, the emphasis is on:
1.  **Circuit Representation:** Translating a neural network computation into an R1CS (Rank-1 Constraint System) compatible form.
2.  **Witness Generation:** Populating all intermediate values in the circuit.
3.  **Constraint Building:** Demonstrating how arithmetic operations and non-linearities (like ReLU) are expressed as R1CS constraints.
4.  **Conceptual Prover/Verifier Logic:** Simulating the steps a SNARK prover and verifier would take to establish and verify a proof, focusing on the data flow and logical checks.

**Outline and Function Summary:**

The project is structured into three main parts:

---

## **I. Core ZKP Framework (R1CS-Inspired)**

This section defines the fundamental components for building and evaluating arithmetic circuits compatible with ZKP.

*   **`FieldElement`**: A type representing an element in a finite field, used for all computations within the ZKP circuit.
    *   `NewFieldElement(val int64)`: Creates a new FieldElement from an int64 value.
    *   `Add(b FieldElement)`: Adds two field elements.
    *   `Sub(b FieldElement)`: Subtracts two field elements.
    *   `Mul(b FieldElement)`: Multiplies two field elements.
    *   `Inverse()`: Computes the modular multiplicative inverse of a field element.
    *   `IsZero()`: Checks if the field element is zero.
    *   `Int64()`: Converts field element to int64 (for display/debugging, might lose precision).
*   **`Variable`**: Represents a wire in the arithmetic circuit, identified by an index in the witness vector.
*   **`R1CSConstraint`**: Defines a single constraint of the form `A * W + B * W = C * W`, where W is the witness vector.
*   **`CircuitDefinition`**: Holds the entire R1CS representation of the computation.
    *   `NewCircuitDefinition()`: Initializes an empty circuit definition.
    *   `AddPublicInput(name string)`: Registers a public input variable.
    *   `AddPrivateInput(name string)`: Registers a private input variable.
    *   `AddIntermediateVariable(name string)`: Registers an intermediate computation variable.
    *   `AddConstant(val FieldElement)`: Registers a constant value in the circuit.
    *   `AddAdditionConstraint(a, b, sum Variable)`: Adds a constraint `a + b = sum`.
    *   `AddMultiplicationConstraint(a, b, product Variable)`: Adds a constraint `a * b = product`.
    *   `AddIsZeroConstraint(val, inverse, result Variable)`: Adds constraints to prove `result = 1` if `val == 0`, else `result = 0`. Requires an auxiliary `inverse` variable.
    *   `AddBooleanConstraint(b Variable)`: Ensures `b` is either 0 or 1.
    *   `AddRangeProofConstraint(val Variable, numBits int)`: Proves `0 <= val < 2^numBits` by decomposing `val` into bits and constraining them.
*   **`Witness`**: A mapping of variable indices to their `FieldElement` values, representing all inputs and intermediate computation results.
    *   `NewWitness(circuit *CircuitDefinition)`: Initializes a witness based on the circuit variables.
    *   `Set(v Variable, val FieldElement)`: Sets the value of a specific variable in the witness.
    *   `Get(v Variable)`: Retrieves the value of a specific variable.
*   **`GenerateWitness(circuit *CircuitDefinition, public map[string]FieldElement, private map[string]FieldElement)`**: Computes all intermediate values required to satisfy the circuit's constraints, given public and private inputs. This is a crucial "prover" side operation.
*   **`CheckCircuitSatisfiability(circuit *CircuitDefinition, witness *Witness)`**: Verifies if the given witness satisfies all constraints in the circuit.

## **II. Neural Network Specific Circuit Builders**

This section leverages the core R1CS framework to build circuits for common neural network operations.

*   **`AddVectorDotProductConstraints(circuit *CircuitDefinition, vecA, vecB []Variable, result Variable)`**: Adds constraints for the dot product of two vectors, placing the result into `result`.
*   **`AddMatrixVectorMultiplicationConstraints(circuit *CircuitDefinition, matrix [][]Variable, vector []Variable, resultVec []Variable)`**: Adds constraints for matrix-vector multiplication (`resultVec = matrix * vector`).
*   **`AddVectorBiasAdditionConstraints(circuit *CircuitDefinition, vector, bias []Variable, result []Variable)`**: Adds constraints for element-wise vector addition (`result = vector + bias`).
*   **`AddReLUActivationConstraints(circuit *CircuitDefinition, input, output Variable)`**: Adds constraints for the ReLU activation function (`output = max(0, input)`). This uses `AddIsZeroConstraint` and `AddRangeProofConstraint` to handle the conditional logic and non-linearity.
*   **`BuildNNInferenceCircuit(inputSize, hiddenSize, outputSize int, weights1, bias1, weights2, bias2 [][]int)`**: The main function to construct the complete R1CS circuit for a two-layer feed-forward neural network inference. It defines input/output variables, converts model parameters to circuit variables, and calls the specific builders.

---

## **III. Prover and Verifier (Conceptual ZKP Logic)**

This section outlines the conceptual steps of proof generation and verification, abstracting the complex cryptographic primitives.

*   **`ProverCommitment`**: A placeholder struct representing a conceptual cryptographic commitment (e.g., to a polynomial evaluation or a witness vector segment). In a real SNARK, this would involve elliptic curve points.
*   **`ProverProof`**: A struct containing all conceptual elements of the generated ZKP, including public inputs, and various commitments/responses.
*   **`GenerateProof(circuit *CircuitDefinition, witness *Witness, publicInputs map[string]FieldElement)`**: Simulates the ZKP proof generation process. It conceptually "commits" to witness elements and intermediate polynomial evaluations, and prepares "responses" to a simulated random challenge. This function focuses on the *logical steps* of generating data that *would* be cryptographically verifiable.
*   **`VerifyProof(circuit *CircuitDefinition, publicInputs map[string]FieldElement, proof *ProverProof)`**: Simulates the ZKP verification process. It conceptually uses the public inputs and the "proof" elements to check consistency and confirm the computation's validity. This function *does not* perform actual cryptographic checks but verifies the logical consistency of the data provided in the `ProverProof` based on the random challenge.

The implementation uses `math/big` for `FieldElement` operations to handle large numbers required for finite field arithmetic. The chosen prime modulus (`MODULUS`) is a large number to ensure sufficient security and avoid trivial collisions.

This system provides a robust conceptual framework for understanding how complex computations like neural network inference can be made verifiable using ZKPs, even without revealing sensitive underlying data or model parameters.
