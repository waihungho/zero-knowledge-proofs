Each function outline below will include:
    - Function Name (as listed above)

    - Prover's Public Input(s)
    - Verifier's Public Input(s)

This code is intended as a conceptual outline and does not contain actual cryptographic implementations.  Real-world ZKP implementations would require sophisticated cryptographic libraries and protocols.
