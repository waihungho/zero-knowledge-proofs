    *   SimulateZKProof(statement, parameters): Simulates a ZKP generation process (for testing and understanding flow, no actual secret key involved, just structure demonstration). (Simulation for Testing/Understanding)
    *   ExtractZeroKnowledgeInformation(proof, parameters): (Potentially - depending on the ZKP scheme) Attempts to extract minimal zero-knowledge information from a proof for auditing or logging purposes (carefully designed to maintain ZK property). (ZK Information Extraction - Advanced Concept - Use with Caution and Scheme-Specific)

This package provides a framework for exploring advanced ZKP concepts with practical Go code examples.
It emphasizes creativity and trendiness by incorporating ideas like conditional proofs, set membership proofs,

	// In additive notation (if using elliptic curves), it would be R' + c*publicKey = s*G
	// Here, we'll use multiplicative (exponentiation) notation as in typical Schnorr.

	rhs := gs // Right-hand side: g^s
	lhs := publicKeyC // Left-hand side starts with publicKey^c

	// Need to compute R' now. But in verification, we want to check if H(R' || message) == c.
	// Let's re-arrange the verification equation to avoid inverse, which can be more complex in modular arithmetic.
	// Verify: g^s = R * publicKey^c  =>  g^s == R * (g^secret)^c => g^s == g^k * g^(secret*c) => g^s == g^(k + secret*c) => s == k + secret*c (mod order)

	// We need to recompute the commitment R from the proof (challenge and response) and public key.
	// In standard Schnorr, the verifier does not recompute R directly but checks the equation.
	// Instead, we will reconstruct what R *should* be based on the proof and public key.

	// We know that R = g^k and s = k + c*secret => k = s - c*secret. So R = g^(s - c*secret) = g^s * (g^(secret))^-c = g^s * (publicKey)^-c.
	// Or, more conveniently, R * publicKey^c = g^s.  We need to check if H(R || message) == c.

	// Let's compute R' = g^s * (publicKey^-c) - this is computationally a bit more involved with modular inverse.
	// A simpler approach for verification is to compute g^s and publicKey^c, multiply them (modulus), and compare the hash of the result with the provided challenge.

	// Recompute R from proof and publicKey.  This is slightly deviating from standard Schnorr verification for simplicity in this example, focusing on the concept.
	// In a proper Schnorr, you usually check an equation involving exponents directly.
	// Here, for demonstration, we'll try to reconstruct R and re-hash.

	// Let's simplify to a more direct check based on the relationship:  g^s = R * (publicKey)^c
	// We have 's' (response), 'c' (challenge), and 'publicKey'.  We need to find 'R' such that g^s = R * (publicKey)^c.
	// In real Schnorr, 'R' is sent by the prover initially.  In this simplified example, we're verifying based on the relationship.

	// Recalculate based on g^s == R * publicKey^c => R = g^s * (publicKey)^(-c)
	// But, let's re-think:  Verifier needs to check if H(R || message) == c, where R = g^k and s = k + c*secret.
	// Verifier has publicKey = g^secret.

	//  Let's verify g^s == R * (publicKey)^c.  We need to find R.  R is not directly in the proof.
	//  In Schnorr, the protocol is: Prover sends R, then verifier sends c, then prover sends s. Verifier checks if g^s == R * (publicKey)^c  and if H(R || message) == c.

	//  Let's assume in our simplified 'proof', 'Challenge' is 'c' and 'Response' is 's'.
	//  We need to reconstruct 'R' from 's', 'c', and 'publicKey'.  But that's going backwards.

	//  Correct Verification in Schnorr:
	//  1. Verifier computes R' = (g^s) * (publicKey^-c)  (or R' * publicKey^c = g^s)
	//  2. Verifier checks if H(R' || message) == c.

	// Let's adjust the verification to be closer to standard Schnorr.
	// Recompute R' = g^s * (publicKey)^(-c) in modular arithmetic.
	// Modular inverse needed for publicKey^-c.  Let's simplify further for this example.

	// Let's check the equation: g^s == R * (publicKey)^c.  We can compute both sides.
	gs_check := new(big.Int).Exp(params.Generator, proof.Response, params.Modulus)
	publicKeyC_check := new(big.Int).Exp(publicKey, proof.Challenge, params.Modulus)

	// We need 'R'.  R in standard Schnorr is sent by the prover. In our simplified proof, we don't have explicit 'R'.
	// Let's adjust the proof generation to include 'R'.  But for now, let's try to verify what we have.

	// Let's simplify verification to:  Check if H(g^Response || message) == Challenge  (This is NOT standard Schnorr but a simplification for demonstration).

**Explanation and Advanced Concepts Implemented (as placeholders and concepts):**

1.  **Setup Functions:**
    *   `GenerateZKParameters()`:  Sets up global parameters. In real ZKP, this is crucial for security and would involve group selection, generator selection, etc. Here, it's simplified.
    *   `InitializeProver()`, `InitializeVerifier()`: Basic initialization steps for prover and verifier roles.

2.  **Core ZKP Primitives:**
    *   `CommitToValue()`, `OpenCommitment()`:  Demonstrates a commitment scheme (simplified Pedersen-like). Commitments are fundamental in many ZKP protocols to hide values initially.
    *   `GenerateSchnorrProof()`, `VerifySchnorrProof()`: Implements a simplified Schnorr signature-based ZKP for proving knowledge of a secret key. Schnorr is a classic and relatively efficient ZKP protocol. **Note:** The `VerifySchnorrProof` in this example is simplified and not fully cryptographically secure Schnorr verification for brevity and demonstration of concept. A proper implementation would require more careful modular arithmetic and potentially elliptic curve groups for security.

3.  **Advanced ZKP Functions (Creative and Trendy):**
    *   `ProveRangeInclusion()`, `VerifyRangeInclusionProof()`:  **Range Proofs** are a very useful advanced ZKP concept. They allow proving that a value is within a certain range without revealing the value itself.  Applications include age verification, credit scores, etc.  This implementation uses placeholders (`DummyRangeProofData`). Real range proofs are complex (e.g., Bulletproofs, ZK Range Proofs based on Sigma protocols).
    *   `ProveSetMembership()`, `VerifySetMembershipProof()`: **Set Membership Proofs**. Proving that an element belongs to a set without revealing the element or the set. Useful for whitelists, blacklists, proving eligibility without revealing specific identifiers. Placeholder implementation. Real implementations use Merkle trees, accumulators, etc.
    *   `ProveDataIntegrity()`, `VerifyDataIntegrityProof()`: **Data Integrity Proof**. Proving that data is authentic and hasn't been tampered with based on a hash, without revealing the original data. Conceptual placeholder. Real implementations would involve cryptographic commitments and potentially succinct arguments.

4.  **Conditional ZKP and Logic:**
    *   `ProveConditionalStatement()`, `VerifyConditionalStatementProof()`: **Conditional Proofs**. Creating proofs that are valid only if certain conditions (often other ZKPs) are met. This allows for more complex logic in ZKP systems. The example is conceptual.
    *   `ProveANDStatement()`, `VerifyANDStatementProof()`: **AND Composition**. Combining multiple ZKPs to prove that multiple statements are true simultaneously. Basic composition demonstrated. More complex compositions exist in ZKP research.

5.  **Privacy-Preserving Computation (ZKP Concepts Applied):**
    *   `ProveEncryptedValueProperty()`, `VerifyEncryptedValuePropertyProof()`: **Property Proofs on Encrypted Data**. This is a very trendy and advanced concept.  Proving properties of encrypted data *without* decrypting it. This often combines ZKP with homomorphic encryption or other privacy-enhancing technologies.  The example is highly conceptual. Real implementations are complex and depend on the chosen encryption and ZKP schemes.
    *   `SimulateZKProof()`: **Simulation for Testing/Understanding**.  A utility function to simulate the *structure* of a ZKP process without actual cryptography. Useful for debugging and understanding the flow of a protocol.
    *   `ExtractZeroKnowledgeInformation()`: **ZK Information Extraction (Advanced Concept - Use with Extreme Caution)**. This is a highly advanced and potentially risky concept. In *most* ZKP scenarios, extracting *any* information from a proof can break the zero-knowledge property.  However, in very specific, carefully designed systems, it *might* be possible to extract *minimal* non-sensitive information from a proof for auditing or logging purposes, while still aiming to maintain the core ZK property as much as possible.  **This is very scheme-specific, requires deep cryptographic analysis, and should be used with extreme caution only if justified by a specific application and security analysis.**  The example function is very basic and just illustrates the idea of trying to get *some* non-sensitive information from a proof (like lengths of components, not the actual cryptographic values themselves).

**Important Notes:**

*   **Placeholders and Simplifications:** Many of the "advanced" ZKP functions (`ProveRangeInclusion`, `ProveSetMembership`, `ProveDataIntegrity`, `ProveEncryptedValueProperty`) are implemented with placeholder proof data (`Dummy...ProofData`) and placeholder verification. **These are NOT real, cryptographically secure implementations.** They are meant to illustrate the *concept* and structure of such functions. To create real ZKP implementations, you would need to use established cryptographic libraries and implement specific ZKP protocols (e.g., for range proofs, use Bulletproofs or similar libraries; for set membership, use Merkle trees or accumulators with appropriate ZKP techniques).
*   **Security:** The `SchnorrProof` example is also simplified for demonstration and is not a production-ready secure Schnorr signature or ZKP implementation. Real Schnorr implementations would require more robust parameter generation, potentially elliptic curve groups, and careful modular arithmetic.
*   **"Trendy" and "Creative":** The function names and concepts are designed to reflect trendy areas in ZKP research and applications (range proofs, set membership, privacy-preserving computation, conditional proofs). The "creativity" is in showcasing these concepts in a Go context, even if the implementations are simplified.
*   **No Duplication:** This code avoids direct copying from open-source ZKP libraries. It provides a conceptual framework and simplified examples, rather than a production-ready ZKP library.

To make this code into a truly functional and secure ZKP library, you would need to:

1.  **Replace Placeholders with Real ZKP Protocols:**  Implement actual cryptographic protocols for range proofs, set membership proofs, etc., using established algorithms and libraries.
2.  **Use Cryptographically Secure Libraries:** Utilize robust Go cryptographic libraries for group operations, hashing, random number generation, etc.
3.  **Rigorous Security Analysis:**  For any real-world application, conduct a thorough security analysis of the implemented ZKP protocols to ensure they meet the required security properties (completeness, soundness, zero-knowledge).
4.  **Parameter Selection:** Carefully select cryptographic parameters (groups, generators, hash functions, etc.) to ensure security against known attacks.
