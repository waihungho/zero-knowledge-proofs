// Package zkpapp provides a conceptual framework in Golang for building applications
// that leverage Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for various advanced use cases.
// This code focuses on defining the *application-level functions* that ZKPs enable,
// rather than providing a production-ready, low-level ZKP cryptographic library.
//
// The cryptographic primitives for ZKP generation and verification are represented
// by placeholder functions. A real-world implementation would integrate with
// established ZKP libraries (e.g., gnark, curve25519-dalek based libraries) for
// specific schemes like Groth16, PLONK, bulletproofs, etc.
//
// Outline:
// 1. Core ZKP Structures (Statement, Witness, Proof)
// 2. ZKP Placeholder Backend (Simulated cryptographic operations)
// 3. ZKPService Struct (Container for ZKP-enabled application functions)
// 4. Advanced ZKP-Enabled Application Functions (20+ distinct functions)
