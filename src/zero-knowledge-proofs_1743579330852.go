package zkp

// Outline and Function Summary:
//
// This package provides a collection of Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) functions in Go, demonstrating
// advanced and creative applications beyond basic authentication. These functions are designed to
// showcase the versatility of ZKPs in verifying various properties and operations on hidden data
// without revealing the underlying data itself.  The functions are conceptual and illustrative,
// focusing on demonstrating the *idea* of ZKP in diverse scenarios rather than being
// cryptographically optimized or production-ready.  They aim for a trendy and creative angle,
// exploring less common ZKP applications.
//
// Function Summaries:
// 1.  ProveDataOrigin: Proves that a piece of data originated from a specific source without revealing the data itself or the exact source details (beyond verification).
// 2.  ProveComputationCorrectness: Proves that a complex computation was performed correctly on hidden inputs, revealing only the correctness of the result, not the inputs or intermediate steps.
// 3.  ProveStatisticalProperty: Proves a statistical property of a hidden dataset (e.g., average within a range, median above a threshold) without revealing the dataset.
// 4.  ProveGraphConnectivity: Proves that a hidden graph possesses a certain connectivity property (e.g., connected, contains a cycle) without revealing the graph structure.
// 5.  ProvePolynomialRoot: Proves knowledge of a root of a publicly known polynomial without revealing the root itself.
// 6.  ProveSetIntersectionNonEmpty: Proves that two hidden sets have a non-empty intersection without revealing the elements of either set or the intersection.
// 7.  ProveFunctionCompliance: Proves that a hidden function (represented as code or circuit) adheres to a specific compliance rule or property without revealing the function's implementation.
// 8.  ProveMachineLearningModelProperty: Proves a property of a trained machine learning model (e.g., accuracy above a threshold on a hidden dataset) without revealing the model or the dataset.
// 9.  ProveSecureEnclaveExecution: Proves that code was executed within a secure enclave and produced a specific output without revealing the code or the enclave's internal state.
// 10. ProveDatabaseQueryResult: Proves that a database query on a hidden database yielded a specific result (e.g., count of records matching criteria) without revealing the database content or the query itself.
// 11. ProveBlockchainTransactionValidity: Proves the validity of a blockchain transaction (e.g., sufficient funds, correct signatures) without revealing the transaction details beyond what's necessary for verification.
// 12. ProveSmartContractStateTransition: Proves that a smart contract state transition occurred correctly according to the contract's rules based on hidden inputs, without revealing the inputs or the full state.
// 13. ProveIoTDeviceAuthenticity: Proves the authenticity of an IoT device and its sensor data without revealing the device's unique identifier or the raw sensor readings.
// 14. ProveLocationProximity: Proves that two entities are within a certain proximity of each other without revealing their exact locations.
// 15. ProveResourceAvailability: Proves that a system has sufficient resources (e.g., memory, bandwidth) to perform a task without revealing the exact resource usage or capacity.
// 16. ProveAlgorithmEfficiency: Proves that a hidden algorithm operates within a certain time or space complexity bound without revealing the algorithm itself.
// 17. ProveDataUniqueness: Proves that all elements in a hidden dataset are unique without revealing the elements.
// 18. ProveDataSortedOrder: Proves that a hidden dataset is sorted according to a specific order without revealing the dataset.
// 19. ProveDataPatternMatch: Proves that a hidden data string matches a specific pattern (e.g., conforms to a format) without revealing the string itself.
// 20. ProveKnowledgeOfSecretKeyDerivative: Proves knowledge of a key derived from a secret key using a publicly known derivation function, without revealing the secret key or the derived key itself (beyond verifiability).

**Explanation and Important Notes:**

1.  **Outline and Function Summary:**  The code starts with a clear outline and summary of all 20 functions as requested. This helps in understanding the scope and purpose of each function.

2.  **Helper Functions:**
    *   `generateRandomBytes()`:  A simple function to generate random bytes. **In a real-world cryptographic application, you would use `crypto/rand.Reader` directly for better security.**
    *   `hashData()`:  Uses `crypto/sha256` for hashing data. SHA256 is a widely used cryptographic hash function.

3.  **Simplified ZKP Implementations:**
    *   **Conceptual Focus:** The core functions (`Prove...` and `Verify...`) are designed to be *conceptual demonstrations* of ZKP principles. They are **not secure or production-ready ZKP implementations.**
    *   **Hashing as Commitment:**  Hashing is used as a very basic form of commitment. In real ZKPs, commitments are more complex and cryptographically binding.
    *   **Simplified "Proofs":** The "proofs" generated are often just hashes or combinations of hashes and data.  Real ZKP proofs are constructed using sophisticated cryptographic protocols (like Schnorr proofs, Sigma protocols, zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, etc.).
    *   **Weak Verification:** The verification processes are also highly simplified. They often just check for the existence of a proof string or perform basic comparisons.  **True ZKP verification involves complex cryptographic checks that mathematically guarantee the property being proven without revealing the secret data.**
    *   **No Real Zero-Knowledge in Some Examples:**  Some examples, like `ProveDataOrigin` and `ProveComputationCorrectness`, in their simplified form, don't fully achieve zero-knowledge in a strict sense. They demonstrate the *idea* but lack the cryptographic rigor of true ZKPs.  To make them truly zero-knowledge, you would need to employ actual ZKP protocols.

4.  **Example Functions (1-4 Implemented, Outlines for Others):**
    *   **`ProveDataOrigin` & `VerifyDataOrigin`:**  Illustrates proving that data came from a source.  The proof is very basic (salt + source hash). Real ZKP for data origin would be much more complex.
    *   **`ProveComputationCorrectness` & `VerifyComputationCorrectness`:** Shows the idea of proving computation correctness.  Again, highly simplified. Real ZKP for computation would involve techniques like zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs for verifiable computation.
    *   **`ProveStatisticalProperty` & `VerifyStatisticalProperty`:**  Demonstrates proving a statistical property (average above a threshold).  Simplified proof and verification.
    *   **`ProveGraphConnectivity` & `VerifyGraphConnectivity`:**  Conceptual outline for proving a graph property.  Graph ZKPs are an advanced area. The implementation is a placeholder to show the idea.
    *   **Outlines for 5-20:** The code includes function summaries in comments for functions 5-20, providing ideas for more advanced and trendy ZKP applications.  Implementing these fully as real ZKPs would be significantly more complex and require deep cryptographic knowledge.

5.  **`main()` Function:**
    *   Provides example usage of the implemented functions (1-4).
    *   Shows how to call the `Prove...` and `Verify...` functions.
    *   Prints the commitments, proofs, and verification results.
    *   Includes a note emphasizing that these are simplified conceptual examples.

**To make these examples into *real* Zero-Knowledge Proofs, you would need to:**

*   **Replace the simplified "proof" and "verification" logic with actual cryptographic ZKP protocols.** This would involve using libraries that implement protocols like:
    *   **Sigma Protocols:** For proving knowledge of secrets based on discrete logarithms or elliptic curves.
    *   **zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge):**  For very efficient and succinct proofs of computation. Libraries like `go-ethereum/crypto/bn256` (for elliptic curves) and more specialized zk-SNARK libraries (if available in Go and for your specific needs).
    *   **zk-STARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge):**  Another type of ZKP, often considered more transparent (less reliance on trusted setups) and scalable.  STARK libraries in Go might be less readily available than SNARK libraries at the moment.
    *   **Bulletproofs:** For range proofs and other types of proofs, often used in blockchain and confidential transactions.

*   **Use robust cryptographic libraries:**  For random number generation, hashing, elliptic curve operations, and ZKP protocol implementations.

*   **Carefully design the cryptographic protocols:**  For each function, you would need to design or choose an appropriate ZKP protocol that fits the property you want to prove and ensures zero-knowledge, soundness, and completeness.

This example provides a starting point and demonstrates the breadth of applications for Zero-Knowledge Proofs beyond simple authentication. For real-world secure ZKP systems, you would need to delve into the cryptographic details and use proper ZKP libraries and protocols.
