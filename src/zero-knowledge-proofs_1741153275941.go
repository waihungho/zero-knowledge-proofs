# Zero-Knowledge Proof in Golang: Private Data Aggregation for Anonymous Surveys

**Outline and Function Summary:**

This Go program demonstrates a Zero-Knowledge Proof system for private data aggregation in anonymous surveys.  The core idea is that individuals can contribute numerical data (e.g., survey responses, sensor readings) without revealing their individual values, while a verifier can still confirm aggregate statistics (like the sum or average) are calculated correctly over the hidden inputs. This is achieved through a combination of commitment schemes, homomorphic encryption principles (simplified for demonstration), and range proofs (simplified for demonstration).

**Functions:**

**1. Core Cryptographic Building Blocks (Simplified):**

*   `GenerateRandomValue()`: Generates a random integer for cryptographic operations.
*   `CommitValue(value int, randomness int) (commitment int)`: Creates a commitment to a value using a simple commitment scheme (e.g., hash or modular arithmetic - simplified here).
*   `VerifyCommitment(value int, randomness int, commitment int) bool`: Verifies if a value and randomness correspond to a given commitment.
*   `CreateSimplifiedRangeProof(value int, min int, max int, randomness int) (proof RangeProof)`: Generates a simplified range proof demonstrating a value is within a given range without revealing the value itself.  This is a conceptual simplification and not a cryptographically robust range proof in a real-world ZKP system.
*   `VerifySimplifiedRangeProof(proof RangeProof, commitment int, min int, max int) bool`: Verifies the simplified range proof against a commitment and range.

**2. Private Data Aggregation Functions:**

*   `ParticipantContributeData(data int, minData int, maxData int) (commitment int, proof RangeProof, randomness int)`:  A participant generates a commitment and range proof for their private data.
*   `AggregateCommitments(commitments []int) (aggregatedCommitment int)`: Aggregates multiple commitments homomorphically (simplified addition in commitment space).
*   `ComputeAggregateSum(privateData []int) (aggregateSum int)`: (For demonstration purposes only - in a real ZKP, this would be unknown to the verifier initially) Calculates the actual sum of private data.
*   `ProveAggregateSumCorrect(aggregatedCommitment int, revealedSum int, commitments []int, randomValues []int) (proofAggregateSum AggregateSumProof)`: Generates a proof that the revealed aggregate sum corresponds to the aggregated commitments and the original commitments.  This is a simplified demonstration of proving correctness of aggregation.
*   `VerifyAggregateSumProof(proofAggregateSum AggregateSumProof, aggregatedCommitment int, revealedSum int, commitments []int) bool`: Verifies the aggregate sum proof against the aggregated commitment and revealed sum.

**3. Advanced ZKP Concepts (Demonstration/Conceptual):**

*   `CreateConditionalCommitment(value int, condition bool, randomness int) (conditionalCommitment ConditionalCommitment)`: Creates a commitment that is tied to a condition. If the condition is false, the commitment might be to a default value or have a different structure.
*   `ProveConditionalStatement(conditionalCommitment ConditionalCommitment, condition bool, actualValue int, randomness int) (conditionalProof ConditionalProof)`:  Proves a statement about the conditionally committed value based on whether the condition was true or false, without revealing the value directly.
*   `VerifyConditionalStatementProof(conditionalProof ConditionalProof, conditionalCommitment ConditionalCommitment, condition bool) bool`: Verifies the conditional statement proof.
*   `CreateThresholdProof(value int, threshold int, randomness int) (thresholdProof ThresholdProof)`: Creates a proof demonstrating if a value is above or below a threshold, without revealing the exact value.
*   `VerifyThresholdProof(thresholdProof ThresholdProof, commitment int, threshold int) bool`: Verifies the threshold proof against a commitment and threshold.
*   `CreateNonInteractiveProof(value int, statement string) (nonInteractiveProof NonInteractiveProof)`: Demonstrates the concept of a non-interactive ZKP where the prover generates a proof without interaction with the verifier (simplified example - not a full Fiat-Shamir transform).
*   `VerifyNonInteractiveProof(nonInteractiveProof NonInteractiveProof, commitment int, statement string) bool`: Verifies the non-interactive proof.

**4. Utility and Example Functions:**

*   `ExampleSurveyScenario()`: Demonstrates a complete anonymous survey scenario using the ZKP functions.
*   `PrintSuccess(message string)`: Utility function to print success messages with color.
*   `PrintError(message string)`: Utility function to print error messages with color.


**Important Notes:**

*   **Simplified and Conceptual:** This code is for demonstration and educational purposes. It uses *simplified* cryptographic concepts and is **not secure for real-world applications**.  Real ZKP systems require robust cryptographic libraries and protocols.
*   **Homomorphic Encryption (Simplified):**  The commitment aggregation is a highly simplified form of homomorphic addition. True homomorphic encryption is much more complex.
*   **Range Proofs (Simplified):** The range proofs are conceptual and not cryptographically secure range proofs like Bulletproofs or similar.
*   **Security Considerations:**  This code is vulnerable to various attacks in a real-world setting. Do not use it for production systems requiring security.
*   **Focus on ZKP Principles:** The goal is to illustrate the *principles* of Zero-Knowledge Proofs, such as proving knowledge or properties without revealing the underlying data.

This program provides a starting point to understand the basic building blocks and concepts of Zero-Knowledge Proofs in a practical Go context.  For real-world ZKP implementations, use established cryptographic libraries and consult with security experts.
