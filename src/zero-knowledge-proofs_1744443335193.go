Outline and Function Summary:

Package zkp_advanced demonstrates advanced concepts in Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) using Golang, focusing on a novel application: **Decentralized Reputation System with Privacy-Preserving Feedback**.

This system allows users to build reputation based on interactions and feedback, while keeping individual feedback content and user identities private from each other and potentially even the system administrators.  It leverages ZKP to prove properties of feedback without revealing the feedback itself, enabling a trust-based system without sacrificing privacy.

**Function Summary (20+ Functions):**

**1. `GenerateRandomScalar()`:**  (Crypto Utility) Generates a cryptographically secure random scalar (big integer) for use in cryptographic operations. Fundamental for randomness in ZKP.

**2. `CommitToFeedback(feedback string, randomness *big.Int) (*Commitment, error)`:** (Core ZKP) Commits to a user's feedback string using a cryptographic commitment scheme (e.g., Pedersen Commitment).  Hides the feedback content.

**3. `OpenCommitment(commitment *Commitment, feedback string, randomness *big.Int) (bool, error)`:** (Core ZKP) Verifies if a given feedback string and randomness correctly open a previously created commitment.

**4. `GenerateFeedbackProof(feedback string, randomness *big.Int, commitment *Commitment, reputationScore int) (*FeedbackProof, error)`:** (Advanced ZKP - Main Proof Generation)  Generates a Zero-Knowledge Proof demonstrating that:
    * A commitment was made to *some* feedback.
    * The feedback, when processed by a (hypothetical, private) sentiment analysis function, results in a sentiment score that *contributes positively* to the user's reputation (e.g., positive or neutral feedback).
    * *Without revealing the actual feedback string or the exact sentiment score.*

**5. `VerifyFeedbackProof(proof *FeedbackProof, commitment *Commitment, reputationScore int) (bool, error)`:** (Advanced ZKP - Proof Verification) Verifies the generated `FeedbackProof` against the commitment and current reputation score.  Confirms the properties proven in `GenerateFeedbackProof` are valid.

**6. `InitializeReputation(userID string) error`:** (Reputation System) Initializes a new user's reputation score in the decentralized reputation system.

**7. `SubmitFeedbackCommitment(userID string, commitment *Commitment) error`:** (Reputation System) Allows a user to submit a commitment to their feedback associated with their user ID.  Stored in the system (e.g., a database or distributed ledger).

**8. `RequestFeedbackProof(userID string, commitment *Commitment) (*ProofRequest, error)`:** (Reputation System - Verifier Role) A verifier (or the system itself for reputation update) requests a feedback proof for a given user and commitment.  (In a real system, this might include challenges/nonces).

**9. `RespondToProofRequest(request *ProofRequest, feedback string, randomness *big.Int, commitment *Commitment, reputationScore int) (*FeedbackProof, error)`:** (Reputation System - Prover Role) User responds to a proof request by generating a `FeedbackProof` using their feedback, randomness, and commitment.

**10. `ProcessFeedbackProof(userID string, proof *FeedbackProof, commitment *Commitment) error`:** (Reputation System - System Logic) The system (or a designated processor) processes a received `FeedbackProof` and commitment.  If the proof verifies, it updates the user's reputation score.

**11. `GetReputationScore(userID string) (int, error)`:** (Reputation System) Retrieves a user's current reputation score from the system.

**12. `GenerateReputationThresholdProof(userID string, threshold int) (*ReputationThresholdProof, error)`:** (Advanced ZKP) Generates a ZKP demonstrating that a user's reputation score is *above a certain threshold* without revealing their exact score. Useful for access control or tiered systems.

**13. `VerifyReputationThresholdProof(proof *ReputationThresholdProof, threshold int) (bool, error)`:** (Advanced ZKP) Verifies the `ReputationThresholdProof`.

**14. `GenerateInteractionProof(userA string, userB string, interactionDetails string, randomness *big.Int) (*InteractionProof, error)`:** (Extensibility - Interaction Proof)  Generates a ZKP proving that an interaction occurred between two users with certain details, *without revealing the interactionDetails* (e.g., proving a transaction happened without revealing transaction amount).

**15. `VerifyInteractionProof(proof *InteractionProof, userA string, userB string) (bool, error)`:** (Extensibility - Interaction Proof) Verifies the `InteractionProof`.

**16. `GenerateFeedbackAttributionProof(feedback string, randomness *big.Int, commitment *Commitment, userID string) (*FeedbackAttributionProof, error)`:** (Optional Advanced ZKP - For certain use cases) Generates a ZKP that proves a commitment was made by a *specific user* without revealing the feedback itself. This adds attribution while still protecting feedback content.  Use with caution as it reveals sender identity.

**17. `VerifyFeedbackAttributionProof(proof *FeedbackAttributionProof, commitment *Commitment, userID string) (bool, error)`:** (Optional Advanced ZKP) Verifies the `FeedbackAttributionProof`.

**18. `GenerateSystemAuditProof(timeRange StartTime, EndTime)`:** (System Integrity/Auditability - Concept)  (Conceptual - would require system logs/state)  Generates a ZKP that proves the integrity of the reputation system's state or operations within a given time range.  Ensures no tampering or unauthorized changes. This is a high-level concept and requires defining what system state to prove.

**19. `VerifySystemAuditProof(proof *SystemAuditProof)`:** (System Integrity/Auditability - Concept) Verifies the `SystemAuditProof`.

**20. `GenerateDataAvailabilityProof(commitment *Commitment, dataHash string)`:** (Data Availability - Concept) (Conceptual - in context of distributed ledger) Generates a ZKP proving that the data corresponding to a commitment (or hash) is available on the decentralized system, without revealing the data itself.  Important for decentralized systems to ensure data isn't lost or censored.

**21. `VerifyDataAvailabilityProof(proof *DataAvailabilityProof, commitment *Commitment, dataHash string)`:** (Data Availability - Concept) Verifies the `DataAvailabilityProof`.

**Note:** This code provides a conceptual framework and illustrative functions.  A full implementation would require:
* **Concrete cryptographic library integration:** Choosing and using a Go crypto library for elliptic curve operations, hash functions, etc. (e.g., `crypto/elliptic`, `crypto/sha256`, a ZKP library if available and suitable - but the request was to avoid existing open source).
* **Sentiment Analysis (Placeholder):**  The `processSentiment` function is a placeholder and needs to be replaced with a real (or simulated) sentiment analysis mechanism.  In a true ZKP setting, this sentiment analysis would ideally be done in a way that its output *can* be proven in zero-knowledge, which is a very advanced topic (homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation).  For simplicity here, we assume a function that gives a score, and we prove properties *related* to this score without revealing the score itself directly in the proof.
* **Reputation Storage:**  A mechanism to store and update reputation scores (e.g., in-memory, database, distributed ledger).
* **Proof System Details:**  The `Commitment`, `FeedbackProof`, `ReputationThresholdProof`, etc., structs and the proof generation/verification logic are simplified placeholders.  Real ZKP implementations require careful design of the proof protocol and underlying mathematics.  This example focuses on demonstrating the *application* and function structure, not a production-ready ZKP library.
* **Security Considerations:**  This is illustrative code and not audited for security.  Real ZKP implementations must be rigorously reviewed for cryptographic vulnerabilities.
