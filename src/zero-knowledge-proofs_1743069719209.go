/*
Outline and Function Summary:

This Go package, `zkp`, provides a collection of Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) functionalities, going beyond basic demonstrations to explore more advanced and trendy concepts.  It aims to be creative and not directly replicate existing open-source ZKP libraries.

The package focuses on demonstrating ZKPs for various scenarios related to verifiable computation, data privacy, and trust in distributed systems.  It includes functions for proving properties of data, computations, and knowledge without revealing the underlying secrets.

Function List (20+ functions):

1.  **GenerateRandomCommitment(secret interface{}) (commitment, randomness interface{}, err error):**
    *   Summary: Generates a cryptographic commitment to a secret value along with the randomness used.  This is a fundamental building block for many ZKP protocols, allowing a prover to commit to a value without revealing it.  Uses a secure cryptographic commitment scheme.

2.  **VerifyCommitment(commitment, revealedValue, randomness interface{}) (bool, error):**
    *   Summary: Verifies if a revealed value and randomness correctly open a previously generated commitment. This allows a verifier to confirm that the prover is revealing the original committed value.

3.  **ProveRange(value int, min int, max int, commitment, randomness interface{}) (proof interface{}, err error):**
    *   Summary: Generates a ZKP to prove that a committed value lies within a specified range [min, max] without revealing the actual value.  Useful for age verification, salary ranges, or other scenarios where range information is sufficient.

4.  **VerifyRange(commitment, proof interface{}, min int, max int) (bool, error):**
    *   Summary: Verifies the range proof, ensuring that the committed value is indeed within the claimed range without learning the value itself.

5.  **ProveMembership(value interface{}, set []interface{}, commitment, randomness interface{}) (proof interface{}, err error):**
    *   Summary: Creates a ZKP to prove that a committed value is a member of a publicly known set, without revealing which element it is. Useful for proving authorization or category membership.

6.  **VerifyMembership(commitment, proof interface{}, set []interface{}) (bool, error):**
    *   Summary: Verifies the membership proof, confirming that the committed value belongs to the set without revealing the value.

7.  **ProveNonMembership(value interface{}, set []interface{}, commitment, randomness interface{}) (proof interface{}, err error):**
    *   Summary: Generates a ZKP to prove that a committed value is *not* a member of a publicly known set, without revealing the value.  Useful for exclusion lists or negative constraints.

8.  **VerifyNonMembership(commitment, proof interface{}, set []interface{}) (bool, error):**
    *   Summary: Verifies the non-membership proof, ensuring the committed value is indeed not in the given set.

9.  **ProveEquality(commitment1, commitment2, randomness1, randomness2 interface{}) (proof interface{}, err error):**
    *   Summary:  Generates a ZKP to prove that two commitments, generated with potentially different randomness, commit to the same underlying secret value, without revealing the value. Crucial for linking different pieces of information in a ZK way.

10. **VerifyEquality(commitment1, commitment2, proof interface{}) (bool, error):**
    *   Summary: Verifies the equality proof, confirming that both commitments indeed hold the same secret value.

11. **ProveInequality(value1, value2 interface{}, commitment1, commitment2, randomness1, randomness2 interface{}) (proof interface{}, err error):**
    *   Summary: Creates a ZKP to prove that two committed values are *not* equal, without revealing either value.  More complex than equality proof but important for conditional logic in ZKP.

12. **VerifyInequality(commitment1, commitment2, proof interface{}) (bool, error):**
    *   Summary: Verifies the inequality proof, confirming that the committed values are indeed different.

13. **ProveSum(value1 int, value2 int, sum int, commitment1, commitment2, commitmentSum, randomness1, randomness2, randomnessSum interface{}) (proof interface{}, err error):**
    *   Summary: Generates a ZKP to prove that the sum of two committed values equals a publicly known sum value, without revealing the individual values.  Demonstrates verifiable computation on committed data.

14. **VerifySum(commitment1, commitment2, commitmentSum, sum int, proof interface{}) (bool, error):**
    *   Summary: Verifies the sum proof, ensuring that the sum relationship holds for the committed values and the public sum.

15. **ProveProduct(value1 int, value2 int, product int, commitment1, commitment2, commitmentProduct, randomness1, randomness2, randomnessProduct interface{}) (proof interface{}, err error):**
    *   Summary:  Generates a ZKP to prove that the product of two committed values equals a publicly known product value, without revealing the individual values. Extends verifiable computation capabilities to multiplication.

16. **VerifyProduct(commitment1, commitment2, commitmentProduct, product int, proof interface{}) (bool, error):**
    *   Summary: Verifies the product proof, ensuring the product relationship holds.

17. **ProvePolynomialEvaluation(x int, polynomialCoefficients []int, y int, commitmentX, randomnessX interface{}) (proof interface{}, err error):**
    *   Summary: Generates a ZKP to prove that for a given polynomial and a committed value `x`, the evaluation of the polynomial at `x` is equal to a public value `y`, without revealing `x` or the polynomial coefficients (or potentially revealing only the coefficients, depending on the desired proof type).  Demonstrates more complex verifiable computation.

18. **VerifyPolynomialEvaluation(commitmentX, proof interface{}, polynomialCoefficients []int, y int) (bool, error):**
    *   Summary: Verifies the polynomial evaluation proof, ensuring the claimed evaluation is correct.

19. **ProveDataOrigin(dataHash string, ownerPublicKey interface{}, signature interface{}) (proof interface{}, err error):**
    *   Summary: Creates a ZKP that proves the origin of data (identified by its hash) by demonstrating a valid digital signature from the claimed owner's public key, *without* revealing the private key or the actual data itself (beyond its hash). This is a ZK approach to data provenance and authenticity.

20. **VerifyDataOrigin(dataHash string, ownerPublicKey interface{}, proof interface{}) (bool, error):**
    *   Summary: Verifies the data origin proof, confirming that the data hash is indeed signed by the owner corresponding to the provided public key.

21. **ProveConsistentEncryption(plaintext interface{}, ciphertext1 interface{}, ciphertext2 interface{}, encryptionKeyPublicKey interface{}) (proof interface{}, err error):**
    *   Summary: Generates a ZKP to prove that two ciphertexts, `ciphertext1` and `ciphertext2`, both encrypt the same underlying `plaintext` using the same encryption key (public key), without revealing the plaintext or the secret encryption key (if applicable).  Useful for verifiable encryption schemes and ensuring consistent data handling in secure systems.

22. **VerifyConsistentEncryption(ciphertext1 interface{}, ciphertext2 interface{}, encryptionKeyPublicKey interface{}, proof interface{}) (bool, error):**
    *   Summary: Verifies the consistent encryption proof, ensuring that both ciphertexts are indeed encryptions of the same plaintext under the specified public key.


These functions provide a foundation for building more complex ZKP-based applications in Go, covering various aspects of privacy and verifiable computation.  Implementations would require choosing appropriate cryptographic primitives and ZKP protocols for each function, ensuring security and efficiency.

**Explanation of the Code and Concepts:**

1.  **Outline and Function Summary:**  Provides a high-level overview of the package's purpose, scope, and the functionalities offered.

2.  **Function Structure:** Each ZKP function pair (`Prove...` and `Verify...`) follows a similar pattern:
    *   `Prove...`: Takes secret inputs (values, randomness, keys), public inputs (range, set, etc.), and generates a `proof`.  In a real ZKP, the proof generation would involve complex cryptographic operations based on the chosen ZKP protocol.
    *   `Verify...`: Takes the `commitment`, the `proof`, and relevant public parameters, and returns `true` if the proof is valid (i.e., the prover has demonstrated the claimed property in zero-knowledge), and `false` otherwise.  Real verification involves checking the cryptographic validity of the received proof.

3.  **Simplified Examples (Marked with `**Note:**`):**  For many of the more advanced functions (range proof, membership, non-membership, equality, inequality, sum, product, polynomial evaluation, data origin, consistent encryption), the implementations are **highly simplified placeholders**.

    *   **Commitment Scheme:**  A basic SHA-256 hash-based commitment scheme is used for `GenerateRandomCommitment` and `VerifyCommitment`. This is functional for demonstrating the concept of commitment but is not as robust or feature-rich as commitment schemes used in real ZKP systems (like Pedersen commitments, etc.).
    *   **Placeholder Proofs:**  In the simplified functions, the `proof` is often just a string containing information about the inputs (and sometimes even the secrets themselves, for demonstration purposes *only*). **In a real ZKP library, these proofs would be complex cryptographic structures.**
    *   **Simplified Verifications:**  The `Verify...` functions in the simplified examples often just check if the `proof` string is not empty, or perform trivial checks. **Real verification would involve rigorous cryptographic verification algorithms.**

4.  **Conceptual Demonstrations:** The code focuses on demonstrating the *concept* of each ZKP function. It outlines *what* each function is supposed to achieve in zero-knowledge, even if the actual cryptographic implementation is missing or heavily simplified.

5.  **Advanced and Trendy Concepts:** The function list tries to touch upon more advanced and trendy applications of ZKPs:
    *   **Verifiable Computation:**  `ProveSum`, `ProveProduct`, `ProvePolynomialEvaluation` demonstrate proving computations on secret data.
    *   **Data Privacy:** Range proofs, membership proofs, non-membership proofs, equality/inequality proofs are all about proving properties of data without revealing the data itself.
    *   **Data Provenance/Authenticity:** `ProveDataOrigin` explores a ZK approach to verifying data origin.
    *   **Verifiable Encryption:** `ProveConsistentEncryption` touches upon verifiable encryption and consistent data handling.

6.  **Not Production-Ready:** **This code is NOT intended for production use.** It is purely for educational and demonstrational purposes. Real ZKP implementations require careful selection of cryptographic primitives, secure and efficient ZKP protocols (like zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs, etc.), and rigorous security analysis.

7.  **Next Steps (To make it a real ZKP library):** To transform this into a functional and secure ZKP library, you would need to:
    *   **Choose specific ZKP protocols:** Select appropriate ZKP protocols for each function (e.g., Bulletproofs for range proofs, Merkle Trees for membership proofs, etc.).
    *   **Implement cryptographic primitives:** Use robust cryptographic libraries in Go (like `crypto/elliptic`, `crypto/rand`, `go-crypto`, etc.) to implement the underlying cryptographic operations required by the chosen ZKP protocols (e.g., elliptic curve operations, hash functions, commitment schemes, signature schemes).
    *   **Implement proof generation and verification algorithms:**  Code the actual algorithms for generating and verifying ZKP proofs according to the chosen protocols.
    *   **Consider efficiency and security:** Optimize the code for performance and conduct thorough security reviews to ensure the ZKP implementations are secure against attacks.
    *   **Handle different data types:**  Make the functions more generic to handle various data types effectively and securely.

This detailed explanation should help understand the provided Go code and the conceptual nature of these simplified ZKP demonstrations.  It highlights the direction for building a real ZKP library, emphasizing the cryptographic complexity and the need for robust protocol implementations.
