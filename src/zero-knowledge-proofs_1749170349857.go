Okay, let's design a conceptual Zero-Knowledge Proof system in Golang focused on a trendy and advanced application: **Private Access Control based on Policy Evaluation**.

The idea is for a Prover to demonstrate they satisfy *at least one* rule in a public policy, using their private credentials, without revealing *which* rule they satisfied or *what their credentials are*. This moves beyond simple proofs of knowledge of a secret value and into proving properties about hidden data relative to a set of complex conditions.

We will use concepts inspired by polynomial commitments and challenge-response protocols (like those found in modern SNARKs/STARKs), but implemented from fundamental cryptographic primitives (elliptic curves, hashing) to avoid duplicating existing libraries directly. The "polynomials" here will be abstractly represented by their coefficients or derived values committed using Pedersen commitments. The core proof relies on checking a polynomial identity at a random challenge point.

**Important Disclaimer:** This code is a conceptual implementation for educational and creative purposes. It demonstrates the *structure* and *concepts* of an advanced ZKP application. It is **not** production-ready, is not audited, may lack necessary security considerations (like side-channel resistance), and uses simplified representations of complex polynomial/arithmetic circuit concepts. Building a robust, secure ZKP system requires deep cryptographic expertise.
