Outline and Function Summary:

This Go program demonstrates a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) system for anonymous credential verification.  It allows a Prover to prove certain attributes of their credentials to a Verifier without revealing the actual credential values themselves.  This example showcases an "Anonymous Location and Age Verification System" where a user (Prover) can prove they are over a certain age and located within a specific city without disclosing their exact age or city name.

**Core Concept:**  The system uses commitment schemes and cryptographic hashing to construct proofs.  The Prover commits to their credentials, generates proofs based on these commitments and some form of challenge (in this simplified non-interactive version, the "challenge" is implicitly embedded in the verification logic and public parameters), and the Verifier checks these proofs against the commitments and public information.

**Functions (20+):**

**1. `GenerateRandomSalt()`**: Generates a random salt value for cryptographic commitments.
**2. `HashData(data string, salt string)`**: Computes a cryptographic hash of data combined with a salt.
**3. `CommitToAge(age int, salt string)`**: Prover commits to their age using a salt and hashing.
**4. `CommitToLocation(location string, salt string)`**: Prover commits to their location using a salt and hashing.
**5. `CommitToCombinedCredentials(ageCommitment string, locationCommitment string, salt string)`**: Prover commits to the combination of age and location commitments.
**6. `GenerateAgeProofOverThreshold(age int, salt string, thresholdAge int)`**: Prover generates a ZKP to prove their age is above a given threshold *without revealing the actual age*.
**7. `GenerateLocationProofInCity(location string, salt string, targetCity string)`**: Prover generates a ZKP to prove their location is a specific city *without revealing the exact city name (in a real-world scenario, this would be more complex and likely involve ranges or categories)*.
**8. `GenerateCombinedProof(age int, location string, ageSalt string, locationSalt string, combinedSalt string, thresholdAge int, targetCity string)`**: Prover generates a combined ZKP proving both age over threshold and location in target city.
**9. `VerifyAgeProofOverThreshold(ageProof string, ageCommitment string, thresholdAge int)`**: Verifier checks if the age proof is valid and proves age is over the threshold.
**10. `VerifyLocationProofInCity(locationProof string, locationCommitment string, targetCityCommitment string)`**: Verifier checks if the location proof is valid and proves location is in the target city (using commitment of target city for simplicity in this example).
**11. `VerifyCombinedProof(combinedProof string, ageCommitment string, locationCommitment string, thresholdAge int, targetCityCommitment string)`**: Verifier checks the combined proof for both age and location.
**12. `StringToInt(s string)`**: Utility function to convert string to integer (error handling for age parsing).
**13. `IntToString(i int)`**: Utility function to convert integer to string.
**14. `CompareHashes(hash1 string, hash2 string)`**: Utility function to compare two hash strings.
**15. `GenerateTargetCityCommitment(city string, salt string)`**:  Helper function for Verifier to generate a commitment to the target city (in a more complex system, this might be public knowledge or derived differently).
**16. `ExposeAgeCommitment(ageCommitment string)`**: (Demonstration/Debugging)  Simulates exposing the age commitment (in real ZKP, commitments are typically never revealed).  For demonstration only to see the commitment value.
**17. `ExposeLocationCommitment(locationCommitment string)`**: (Demonstration/Debugging) Simulates exposing the location commitment. For demonstration only.
**18. `ExposeCombinedCommitment(combinedCommitment string)`**: (Demonstration/Debugging) Simulates exposing the combined commitment. For demonstration only.
**19. `SimulateProver(age int, location string, thresholdAge int, targetCity string)`**:  Encapsulates the Prover's actions: commitment generation and proof generation for different scenarios.
**20. `SimulateVerifier(ageCommitment string, locationCommitment string, combinedCommitment string, ageProof string, locationProof string, combinedProofString string, thresholdAge int, targetCity string)`**: Encapsulates the Verifier's actions: commitment verification and proof verification for different scenarios.

**Advanced Concepts Demonstrated (beyond basic password proofs):**

* **Attribute-based ZKP:** Proving properties of attributes (age over threshold, location in city) instead of just knowledge of a secret.
* **Combined Proofs:** Demonstrating how to combine proofs for multiple attributes into a single proof.
* **Commitment Schemes:** Utilizing cryptographic commitments as a fundamental building block for ZKP.
* **Non-Interactive (Simplified):**  While not fully non-interactive in a cryptographic sense (no challenge-response in code), the structure is designed to resemble a non-interactive system where the proof generation is independent of direct verifier interaction (in this simplified example). A truly non-interactive ZKP would likely use zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs, which are beyond the scope of this basic illustrative example.

**Important Notes:**

* **Simplified for Demonstration:** This code is for illustrative purposes and is NOT suitable for production-level security.  Real-world ZKP systems use more sophisticated cryptographic primitives and protocols (like zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs, etc.) for efficiency and security.
* **Non-Interactive Simplification:** The "non-interactive" aspect is simplified. True non-interactive ZKPs are cryptographically complex. This example focuses on the conceptual flow.
* **Security Considerations:**  This example uses basic SHA256 hashing. For real-world applications, consider using more robust cryptographic libraries and protocols, and have the system security reviewed by experts.
* **Target City Commitment:**  The `targetCityCommitment` is used for simplicity in verification. In a real system, the "target city" condition might be encoded differently (e.g., through a Merkle tree, public parameters, or range proofs for geographic coordinates).
* **No Real Cryptographic Hardness:** The security of this example is based on the collision resistance of SHA256, but it's not designed to be rigorously secure against a determined attacker.  It's meant to demonstrate the *concept* of ZKP.
