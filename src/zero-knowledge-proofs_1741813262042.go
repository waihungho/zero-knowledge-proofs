Outline and Function Summary:

This Go package demonstrates various Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) concepts through a collection of functions.
It explores advanced and trendy applications of ZKP beyond basic demonstrations, focusing on creative and
interesting functionalities.  The package aims to provide a diverse set of ZKP-related functions,
covering different types of proofs and applications, without duplicating existing open-source libraries
directly in terms of implementation (though concepts are based on established ZKP principles).

Function Summary (20+ Functions):

Core ZKP Primitives:
1.  CommitmentScheme: Demonstrates a simple commitment scheme using hashing.
2.  VerifyCommitment: Verifies a commitment given the revealed value and commitment.
3.  RangeProof:  Simulates a range proof to show a value is within a certain range without revealing the value.
4.  VerifyRangeProof: Verifies the simulated range proof.
5.  MembershipProof:  Demonstrates a proof of membership in a set without revealing the element.
6.  VerifyMembershipProof: Verifies the membership proof.
7.  EqualityProof:  Shows two commitments hold the same underlying value without revealing the value.
8.  VerifyEqualityProof: Verifies the equality proof.
9.  InequalityProof: Shows two commitments hold different underlying values without revealing the values.
10. VerifyInequalityProof: Verifies the inequality proof.

Advanced/Trendy ZKP Applications:
11. AttributeOwnershipProof: Proves ownership of a specific attribute (e.g., age, role) without revealing the attribute value directly, only that it satisfies a condition.
12. VerifyAttributeOwnershipProof: Verifies the attribute ownership proof.
13.  DataOriginProof: Proves the origin of data without revealing the data content, useful for data provenance.
14.  VerifyDataOriginProof: Verifies the data origin proof.
15.  MachineLearningModelPropertyProof:  A conceptual function to demonstrate proving a property of a machine learning model (e.g., accuracy on a test set) without revealing the model itself. (Simplified simulation).
16.  VerifyMachineLearningModelPropertyProof: Verifies the ML model property proof.
17.  AnonymousCredentialProof: Demonstrates proving possession of a credential (e.g., a license, a ticket) without revealing the specific credential itself.
18.  VerifyAnonymousCredentialProof: Verifies the anonymous credential proof.
19.  PrivateSetIntersectionProof: (Conceptual) Demonstrates proving that two parties have a common element in their sets without revealing the elements themselves.
20.  VerifyPrivateSetIntersectionProof: Verifies the private set intersection proof.
21.  ZeroKnowledgeAuctionBidProof: Demonstrates a ZKP for bidding in a sealed-bid auction, proving the bid is valid (e.g., within a range) without revealing the bid value before the auction ends.
22.  VerifyZeroKnowledgeAuctionBidProof: Verifies the auction bid proof.
23.  VerifiableComputationProof: (Simplified) Demonstrates proving that a computation was performed correctly on some secret input, without revealing the input or the intermediate steps.
24.  VerifyVerifiableComputationProof: Verifies the verifiable computation proof.

Note: This is a demonstration package.  For real-world cryptographic applications, use established and audited cryptographic libraries.  These functions are simplified and illustrative, not intended for production security. They often use string manipulations and basic hashing for conceptual clarity rather than robust cryptographic primitives.  For true ZKP implementations, you would typically need to use libraries implementing cryptographic protocols like zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs, etc., which are significantly more complex.
