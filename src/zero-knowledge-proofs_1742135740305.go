Each function below is outlined with:
- Function Signature (Go style)
- Summary of what it proves in zero-knowledge.
- Placeholder comments indicating where ZKP logic would be implemented.

**Important Notes:**

- This is a high-level outline. Implementing these functions would require choosing appropriate ZKP schemes (e.g., Schnorr, Sigma protocols, zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs) and cryptographic libraries.
- The complexity and feasibility of implementing each function vary significantly depending on the chosen ZKP scheme and the underlying problem.
- "ProverData", "VerifierData", "Proof", "Challenge", "Response", etc. are placeholder types.  Real implementations would use concrete cryptographic data structures.
- Error handling and detailed parameter definitions are omitted for brevity but are crucial in real-world implementations.
