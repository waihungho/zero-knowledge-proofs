This project implements a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) system in Golang, focusing on a creative and advanced application: **"Private Federated Learning with Verifiable Aggregation and Confidential Model Updates (with Differential Privacy)"**.

The core idea is to enable clients in a federated learning setup to contribute model updates to an aggregator, ensuring:
1.  **Privacy:** Individual (original) model updates are never revealed. Instead, clients add differential privacy (DP) noise and submit commitments to these "noisy" updates.
2.  **Verifiability (Client Side):** Each client proves, in zero-knowledge, that their noisy update was correctly formed from their original (private) update and a valid, correctly generated DP noise vector. The proof ensures the noise adheres to specified DP parameters.
3.  **Verifiability (Aggregator Side):** The central aggregator proves that the final aggregated model update is correctly computed as the sum of all valid, noisy client updates.
4.  **Confidentiality:** Individual original updates remain private. The aggregated *noisy* update is eventually revealed, but this is expected in DP-FL.

This ZKP system uses a KZG-like Polynomial Commitment Scheme as its foundation.

// main.go - Demonstrates the Zero-Knowledge Proof for Private Federated Learning
//
// This file orchestrates the entire ZKP-enabled federated learning simulation.
// It includes:
// 1. ZKP Setup: Generating the Common Reference String (SRS).
// 2. Client-Side Operations:
//    - Simulating local model updates.
//    - Generating Differential Privacy (DP) noise.
//    - Constructing polynomial representations of original updates, noise, and noisy updates.
//    - Generating a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) to prove:
//      a) The noisy update is the sum of the original update and the noise.
//      b) The noise values adhere to a specified range (for DP properties).
// 3. Aggregator-Side Operations:
//    - Verifying each client's ZKP.
//    - Homomorphically summing client commitments to noisy updates.
//    - Computing the actual aggregated noisy update.
//    - Generating a ZKP to prove the correctness of this aggregation.
// 4. Global Verifier Operations:

//
// This example showcases a "creative, advanced, trendy" application of ZKP,
// moving beyond simple demonstrations by integrating it with privacy-preserving
