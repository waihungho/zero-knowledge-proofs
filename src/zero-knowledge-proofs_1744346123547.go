Outline and Function Summary:

This Go code demonstrates a conceptual Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) system for verifying properties of supply chain data without revealing the underlying data itself.  It focuses on a trendy application of ZKPs in enhancing transparency and trust in supply chains, without compromising privacy or competitive advantages.

The system includes functions to:

**Core ZKP Operations (Conceptual - not cryptographically secure in this example):**

1.  `GenerateRandomScalar()`: Generates a random scalar (placeholder for cryptographic scalars).
2.  `Commit(secret interface{}, randomness interface{}) Commitment`:  Creates a commitment to a secret value using randomness.
3.  `VerifyCommitment(commitment Commitment, revealedSecret interface{}, revealedRandomness interface{}) bool`: Verifies if a revealed secret and randomness match a given commitment.
4.  `ProveRange(value int, min int, max int, witness interface{}) RangeProof`: Generates a ZKP that a value is within a specified range.
5.  `VerifyRangeProof(proof RangeProof, min int, max int) bool`: Verifies a ZKP range proof.
6.  `ProveEquality(value1 interface{}, value2 interface{}, witness interface{}) EqualityProof`: Generates a ZKP that two values are equal without revealing them.
7.  `VerifyEqualityProof(proof EqualityProof) bool`: Verifies a ZKP equality proof.
8.  `ProveMembership(value interface{}, set []interface{}, witness interface{}) MembershipProof`: Generates a ZKP that a value belongs to a set without revealing the value itself.
9.  `VerifyMembershipProof(proof MembershipProof, set []interface{}) bool`: Verifies a ZKP membership proof.

**Supply Chain Application Specific ZKP Functions:**

10. `ProveProductOrigin(originData string, allowedOrigins []string, witness interface{}) ProductOriginProof`: Proves a product originates from an allowed origin without revealing the exact origin (membership proof applied to origins).
11. `VerifyProductOriginProof(proof ProductOriginProof, allowedOrigins []string) bool`: Verifies the product origin proof.
12. `ProveTemperatureCompliance(temperature float64, acceptableRange Range, witness interface{}) TemperatureComplianceProof`: Proves temperature compliance within a range without revealing the exact temperature (range proof applied to temperature).
13. `VerifyTemperatureComplianceProof(proof TemperatureComplianceProof, acceptableRange Range) bool`: Verifies the temperature compliance proof.
14. `ProveQuantityReceived(receivedQuantity int, expectedQuantity int, witness interface{}) QuantityReceivedProof`: Proves received quantity is equal to expected quantity without revealing the actual quantities (equality proof applied to quantities).
15. `VerifyQuantityReceivedProof(proof QuantityReceivedProof) bool`: Verifies the quantity received proof.
16. `ProveBatchIntegrity(batchHash string, originalHash string, witness interface{}) BatchIntegrityProof`: Proves batch integrity by showing the hash of the batch matches the original hash without revealing the hashes themselves (equality proof applied to hashes).
17. `VerifyBatchIntegrityProof(proof BatchIntegrityProof) bool`: Verifies the batch integrity proof.
18. `ProveSustainableSourcing(sourcingCertification string, validCertifications []string, witness interface{}) SustainableSourcingProof`: Proves sustainable sourcing based on certification without revealing the specific certification (membership proof applied to certifications).
19. `VerifySustainableSourcingProof(proof SustainableSourcingProof, validCertifications []string) bool`: Verifies the sustainable sourcing proof.
20. `ProveEthicalManufacturing(manufacturingAuditScore int, minAcceptableScore int, witness interface{}) EthicalManufacturingProof`: Proves ethical manufacturing by showing an audit score meets a minimum threshold without revealing the exact score (range proof applied to audit score).
21. `VerifyEthicalManufacturingProof(proof EthicalManufacturingProof, minAcceptableScore int) bool`: Verifies the ethical manufacturing proof.
22. `ProveTimestampedEvent(eventHash string, knownEventHashes []string, witness interface{}) TimestampedEventProof`: Proves an event occurred at a specific time and is one of a set of known events without revealing the exact event (membership proof applied to event hashes).
23. `VerifyTimestampedEventProof(proof TimestampedEventProof, knownEventHashes []string) bool`: Verifies the timestamped event proof.


**Important Notes:**

*   **Conceptual & Simplified:** This code is for demonstration purposes and uses simplified logic to represent ZKP concepts. It is **NOT cryptographically secure** and should not be used in production systems requiring actual zero-knowledge proofs.  Real ZKP implementations require complex cryptographic libraries and algorithms (like zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs, etc.).
*   **Witness (Placeholder):** The `witness interface{}` parameters are placeholders. In real ZKP systems, witnesses are crucial cryptographic values that enable proof generation. Here, they are simplified for conceptual clarity.
*   **Data Types:**  Data types are chosen for simplicity. In a real system, you'd likely use more specific and secure data types for cryptographic operations.
*   **No External Libraries:** This example is self-contained and does not rely on external cryptographic libraries to keep it focused on the conceptual structure and function definitions.


The goal is to illustrate how ZKP principles can be applied to various supply chain verification scenarios, enhancing trust and transparency while preserving data privacy.
