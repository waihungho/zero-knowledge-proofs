/*
Outline and Function Summary:

This Go package demonstrates a suite of advanced Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) functions, going beyond basic examples and focusing on trendy, creative, and conceptually advanced applications.  It explores ZKPs in the context of privacy-preserving machine learning, secure data analysis, and verifiable computation.  These functions are designed to showcase the potential of ZKPs in modern applications and are not intended to be production-ready cryptographic implementations but rather conceptual demonstrations.

Function Summary:

1.  GenerateRandomScalar(): Generates a random scalar value for cryptographic operations.
2.  CommitToPolynomial(): Creates a commitment to a polynomial without revealing its coefficients.
3.  ProvePolynomialEvaluation(): Proves the evaluation of a committed polynomial at a specific point without revealing the polynomial itself.
4.  ProveSumOfEncryptedValues():  Proves that the sum of encrypted values (homomorphically encrypted) is within a certain range, without decrypting.
5.  ProveAverageOfDataWithinRange(): Proves that the average of a dataset (represented by commitments) falls within a specified range.
6.  ProveStandardDeviationWithinThreshold(): Proves that the standard deviation of a dataset (commitments) is below a threshold, without revealing individual data points.
7.  ProveDataBelongsToCluster(): Proves that a data point (commitment) belongs to a specific cluster in a pre-defined clustering, without revealing the data point or cluster centers directly.
8.  ProveModelPredictionCorrectness():  Proves that a machine learning model (represented by commitments to its parameters) makes a correct prediction for a given input (commitment), without revealing the model or input.
9.  ProveDifferentialPrivacyApplied(): Proves that a data processing algorithm applied differential privacy, without revealing the algorithm or the privacy budget.
10. ProveSecureAggregationResult():  Proves the correctness of a secure aggregation (e.g., federated learning update) without revealing individual contributions.
11. ProveKnowledgeOfGraphPath(): Proves knowledge of a path between two nodes in a large graph (represented implicitly), without revealing the path itself or the entire graph structure.
12. ProveDataFairnessMetricThreshold(): Proves that a dataset satisfies a certain fairness metric (e.g., demographic parity) above a threshold, without revealing the dataset.
13. ProveAbsenceOfBiasInModel(): Proves (statistically) the absence of a specific type of bias in a machine learning model's output, without revealing the model.
14. ProveCorrectnessOfSecureEnclaveComputation(): Proves that a computation performed inside a secure enclave was executed correctly, without revealing the computation or the enclave's internal state.
15. ProveComplianceWithDataPolicy(): Proves that data processing complies with a predefined data policy (e.g., GDPR constraints), without revealing the policy details or processed data.
16. ProveRealTimeFraudDetection(): Proves that a transaction is not fraudulent based on a complex rule set (represented as commitments), without revealing the rule set or transaction details directly.
17. ProveDecentralizedIdentityAttribute(): Proves possession of a specific attribute from a decentralized identity (DID) without revealing the DID or attribute value directly, only the attribute type.
18. ProveSecureAuctionBidValidity(): Proves that a bid in a secure auction is valid (e.g., above a reserve price, follows bidding rules) without revealing the bid amount or bidder identity.
19. ProveSmartContractConditionMet(): Proves that a complex condition in a smart contract (represented as a predicate on committed state variables) is met, triggering contract execution without revealing the condition or state variables.
20. ProveDataAnonymizationEffectiveness(): Proves that an anonymization technique applied to a dataset effectively protects privacy (e.g., k-anonymity achieved), without revealing the original or anonymized data directly.
