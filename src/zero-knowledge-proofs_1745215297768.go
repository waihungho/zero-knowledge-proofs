Outline and Function Summary:

Package zkp provides a Zero-Knowledge Proof library in Go, focusing on advanced and trendy applications in secure data analysis and privacy-preserving machine learning.  It offers a suite of functions to prove various statements about data without revealing the data itself.

Function Summary (20+ Functions):

Core ZKP Primitives:
1.  ProveRange(secret, min, max): Proves that a secret integer is within a specified range [min, max] without revealing the secret itself. Useful for age verification, credit scores, etc.
2.  ProveMembership(secret, set): Proves that a secret value belongs to a predefined set without revealing the secret or the entire set (efficient for smaller sets).  Useful for whitelist/blacklist verification.
3.  ProveNonMembership(secret, set): Proves that a secret value does *not* belong to a predefined set. Useful for blacklist verification, ensuring uniqueness.
4.  ProveEquality(secret1, secret2): Proves that two secret values are equal without revealing either value. Useful for cross-referencing data without exposure.
5.  ProveInequality(secret1, secret2): Proves that two secret values are *not* equal without revealing them. Useful for ensuring data diversity or identifying anomalies.
6.  ProveAND(proofs...): Combines multiple zero-knowledge proofs using logical AND. Proves that all provided proofs are valid.
7.  ProveOR(proofs...): Combines multiple zero-knowledge proofs using logical OR. Proves that at least one of the provided proofs is valid.
8.  ProveFunctionEvaluation(secretInput, function, publicOutput): Proves that a publicOutput is the correct result of applying a function to a secretInput, without revealing the input or the function's internal workings (for simple, publicly defined functions).

Data Analysis & Privacy-Preserving ML Focus:
9.  ProveAverage(data, average, threshold):  Proves that the average of a secret dataset is within a certain threshold of a publicly known average, without revealing the individual data points. Useful for privacy-preserving statistical analysis.
10. ProveSum(data, sum, threshold): Proves that the sum of a secret dataset is within a threshold of a public sum.
11. ProveVariance(data, variance, threshold): Proves that the variance of a secret dataset is within a threshold of a public variance.
12. ProveLinearRegression(data, weights, target, threshold): Proves that a linear regression model (defined by weights) applied to secret data produces a result close to a public target, without revealing the data or the weights fully (can be adapted to reveal weights ZK).
13. ProvePolynomialEvaluation(secretInput, polynomialCoefficients, publicOutput):  Proves the evaluation of a polynomial with secret input and public coefficients results in a public output. More general function proof than #8.
14. ProveDataDistribution(data, distributionType, distributionParameters): Proves that a secret dataset follows a specific distribution (e.g., normal, uniform) with given parameters, without revealing the data itself. Useful for data quality assurance in privacy-preserving contexts.
15. ProveFeatureImportance(data, featureIndex, importanceScore, threshold): In a dataset, proves that a specific feature (at featureIndex) has an importance score within a threshold of a public score, without revealing the data or feature values. Useful for privacy-preserving feature selection or model explainability.
16. ProveModelAccuracy(data, model, accuracy, threshold): Proves that a (black-box) model achieves a certain accuracy on a secret dataset, without revealing the data or model internals. Useful for verifiable AI without data leakage.
17. ProveDataCorrelation(data1, data2, correlationCoefficient, threshold): Proves that two secret datasets have a correlation coefficient within a certain threshold of a public coefficient, without revealing the datasets.

Advanced ZKP Concepts:
18. ProveKnowledgeOfDiscreteLog(secret, publicValue, generator): Classical ZKP - proves knowledge of the discrete logarithm of a public value with respect to a generator without revealing the secret exponent. Foundation for many crypto protocols.
19. ProveSchnorrSignature(publicKey, message, signature): Verifies a Schnorr signature in zero-knowledge. Proves the signature is valid without revealing the private key used to create it (verifier only needs public key and message).
20. ProveCommitmentOpening(commitment, secret, randomness): Proves that a commitment can be opened to reveal a specific secret value, without revealing the secret prematurely.  Essential building block for many ZKP protocols.
21. ProveZeroSumGameFairness(playerMoves, gameRules, outcome):  (Creative/Trendy) Proves fairness in a zero-sum game.  Given a set of player moves and game rules, proves that the declared outcome is valid according to the rules and moves, without revealing the moves to the other player or an observer.  Useful for secure multi-party computation and verifiable gaming.
22. ProveDifferentialPrivacyGuarantee(data, query, privacyBudget, result): (Advanced/Trendy - connecting ZKP with Differential Privacy) Proves that a query run on a secret dataset satisfies a certain differential privacy guarantee (epsilon and delta), and the returned result is consistent with that privacy guarantee and the data (without revealing the data and ideally even without fully revealing the query internals).  This is a more research-oriented, cutting-edge application.

Note: This is a high-level outline and conceptual code.  A full implementation would require significant cryptographic details and library dependencies (e.g., for elliptic curve cryptography, hash functions, commitment schemes, specific ZKP protocols like Sigma protocols, zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs depending on performance and security requirements, and differential privacy mechanisms for function #22).  This code aims to demonstrate the *structure* and *variety* of ZKP functions and their potential in advanced applications, rather than providing production-ready cryptographic code.
