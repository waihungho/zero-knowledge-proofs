This project implements a conceptual Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) system in Golang, focusing on an advanced and trendy application: **Private DAO Governance with ML-Powered Reputation and Confidential Voting**.

The core idea is to allow a user to prove that their dynamically calculated reputation score (derived from a private Machine Learning model and private user activity data) meets a certain threshold for voting, *without revealing their private activity data, the exact reputation score, or the ML model's weights*. Furthermore, the vote itself is confidential.

This approach leverages multiple ZKP sub-protocols to achieve a composite proof, addressing privacy, trust, and decentralization challenges in modern DAO structures.

---

## Outline

This project is structured into three main packages:

1.  **`zkp`**: Contains generic, abstracted Zero-Knowledge Proof primitives and helper functions. This package aims to provide a high-level conceptual understanding of ZKP components without implementing the full cryptographic complexity of a production-grade zk-SNARK or Bulletproofs library from scratch.
    *   `primitives.go`: Core cryptographic helpers (big integers, hashing, random generation, abstracted group operations).
    *   `circuit.go`: Defines the abstract concept of a ZKP circuit or statement.
    *   `prover.go`: Generic ZKP proving logic.
    *   `verifier.go`: Generic ZKP verification logic.
    *   `types.go`: Data structures for commitments, challenges, proofs, etc.

2.  **`zkdao`**: Implements the specific application logic for Private DAO Governance. It builds upon the `zkp` package to construct complex, multi-party ZKP interactions.
    *   `model.go`: Defines the conceptual Machine Learning model and its operations.
    *   `governance.go`: Manages DAO-level parameters, voter registration, and vote aggregation.
    *   `proofs.go`: Contains the concrete ZKP constructions for proving ML inference correctness and reputation thresholds.
    *   `types.go`: Data structures specific to the DAO application (e.g., `ReputationVoteProof`, `MLInferenceProof`).

3.  **`main.go`**: Demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of the `zkdao` system, showing how a voter generates a private vote and how the DAO verifies it without learning sensitive information.

---

## Function Summary (20+ Functions)

### `zkp` Package:

1.  **`zkp.GenerateSecret()`**: Generates a cryptographically secure random secret (private key, blinding factor).
2.  **`zkp.CommitToValue(value *big.Int, randomness *big.Int, generators *zkp.CommitmentGenerators)`**: Simulates a commitment to a value using a secret randomness. In a real ZKP, this would involve elliptic curve points or polynomial commitments.
3.  **`zkp.VerifyCommitment(commitment *zkp.Commitment, value *big.Int, randomness *big.Int, generators *zkp.CommitmentGenerators)`**: Verifies if a given value and randomness reconstruct the commitment.
4.  **`zkp.GenerateFiatShamirChallenge(transcript []byte)`**: Derives a challenge from a transcript of all public information and previous commitments, crucial for non-interactive ZKPs.
5.  **`zkp.ProverResponse(secret *big.Int, challenge *big.Int, randomness *big.Int)`**: Generates a zero-knowledge response based on the secret, challenge, and randomness.
6.  **`zkp.VerifierCheck(commitment *zkp.Commitment, challenge *big.Int, response *zkp.Response, generators *zkp.CommitmentGenerators)`**: Checks the prover's response against the commitment and challenge.
7.  **`zkp.SetupCommonReferenceString()`**: Simulates a trusted setup phase for public parameters (e.g., generators for commitments).
8.  **`zkp.NewCircuitStatement(id string, publicInputs [][]byte)`**: Creates a new abstract ZKP statement (a "circuit") with public inputs.
9.  **`zkp.ProveStatement(circuit *zkp.CircuitStatement, witness *big.Int, proverSecrets map[string]*big.Int)`**: Proves knowledge of a witness for a given statement, abstractly.
10. **`zkp.VerifyStatement(proof *zkp.Proof, circuit *zkp.CircuitStatement)`**: Verifies a proof against a statement, abstractly.
11. **`zkp.BigIntToBytes(i *big.Int)`**: Converts a big.Int to a byte slice for hashing.
12. **`zkp.BytesToBigInt(b []byte)`**: Converts a byte slice to a big.Int.

### `zkdao` Package:

13. **`zkdao.NewMLModel(weights []*big.Int)`**: Initializes a new conceptual Machine Learning model with private weights.
14. **`zkdao.ComputeReputationScore(model *zkdao.MLModel, privateFeatures []*big.Int)`**: Computes a user's reputation score based on their private activity features and the ML model's weights.
15. **`zkdao.GenerateZeroKnowledgeMLWeightsCommitment(model *zkdao.MLModel, randomness *big.Int, generators *zkp.CommitmentGenerators)`**: Prover commits to the ML model's weights in a zero-knowledge way.
16. **`zkdao.VerifyZeroKnowledgeMLWeightConsistency(commitment *zkp.Commitment, randomness *big.Int, modelWeights []*big.Int, generators *zkp.CommitmentGenerators)`**: Verifier checks if the public commitment matches the model weights, used for initial setup or updates.
17. **`zkdao.ProveMLInferenceCorrectness(privateFeatures []*big.Int, model *zkdao.MLModel, reputationScore *big.Int, generators *zkp.CommitmentGenerators)`**: Prover generates a ZKP that the `reputationScore` was correctly derived from `privateFeatures` and `model.Weights` without revealing them. (This is a complex multi-step ZKP in reality, here abstracted to a single call).
18. **`zkdao.VerifyMLInferenceProof(inferenceProof *zkdao.MLInferenceProof, publicMLModelCommitment *zkp.Commitment, expectedReputationCommitment *zkp.Commitment, generators *zkp.CommitmentGenerators)`**: Verifier checks the proof of correct ML inference.
19. **`zkdao.ProveReputationThreshold(reputationScore *big.Int, threshold *big.Int, randomness *big.Int, generators *zkp.CommitmentGenerators)`**: Prover generates a ZKP that their `reputationScore` is greater than or equal to `threshold` without revealing the `reputationScore`.
20. **`zkdao.VerifyReputationThresholdProof(thresholdProof *zkdao.ReputationThresholdProof, committedReputation *zkp.Commitment, threshold *big.Int, generators *zkp.CommitmentGenerators)`**: Verifier checks the proof of reputation threshold.
21. **`zkdao.CreatePrivateVote(voterID string, proposalID string, voteChoice bool, reputationProof *zkdao.ReputationThresholdProof, mlInferenceProof *zkdao.MLInferenceProof, committedReputation *zkp.Commitment, committedVoteChoice *zkp.Commitment)`**: A voter constructs a private vote incorporating all necessary ZK proofs.
22. **`zkdao.ValidatePrivateVote(vote *zkdao.ReputationVoteProof, dao *zkdao.DAOGovernanceSystem, generators *zkp.CommitmentGenerators)`**: The DAO (or its verifier node) validates a private vote, checking all embedded ZKP proofs.
23. **`zkdao.TallyConfidentiaVotes(validVotes []*zkdao.ReputationVoteProof)`**: Aggregates validated confidential votes (after ZKP verification, the *outcome* is revealed, but not individual choices).
24. **`zkdao.InitializeDAOGovernanceSystem(votingThreshold *big.Int, mlModelWeights []*big.Int)`**: Sets up the initial DAO parameters and the ML model for reputation calculation.

	// For a ZKP of knowledge of `x` for `C = xG + rH`, given `A = s_x G + s_r H`, `c`, `z_x = s_x + c x`, `z_r = s_r + c r`:
	// Verifier checks: `z_x G + z_r H == A + cC`
	// Our `ProverResponse` only gave a single `responseValue`. This means we can only conceptually verify a simpler form.
	// Let's assume the `ProofData` contains the original `blindingFactor` for conceptual verification here,
	// though in a real ZKP, this secret wouldn't be revealed.
	// This is where the abstraction is strongest: we're *simulating* the outcome of a complex verification.

	// In a real ZKP, the `VerifierCheck` would internally use the `proof.InitialCommitment`, `proof.Challenge`,
	// and `proof.Response` to perform cryptographic computations that output true/false.
	// Since we don't have the underlying `witness` or `blindingFactor` here, we cannot directly
	// recreate the initial commitment to compare with `proof.InitialCommitment` without revealing secrets.
	// The point of ZKP is that the verifier does NOT need these secrets.

	// This function returns true assuming the abstract ZKP system would correctly verify.
	// In a complete self-contained ZKP, this would be the actual mathematical verification.
	// For this exercise, `VerifierCheck` will pass if the structure is correct and challenge matches.
