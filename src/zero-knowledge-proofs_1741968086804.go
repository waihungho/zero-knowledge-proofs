// ## Advanced Concepts & Trendy Functionality:

// This library aims to demonstrate advanced ZKP concepts beyond basic identification.
// It incorporates ideas like:

// * **Predicate Proofs:**  Allows constructing proofs for complex logical statements involving multiple secrets and conditions.
// * **Anonymous Credentials:**  Supports issuing and verifying credentials without revealing the underlying attributes, useful for privacy-preserving authentication and authorization.
// * **Conditional Disclosure:** Enables revealing secrets only when certain conditions are met, enhancing control over information sharing.
// * **Range Proofs, Membership/Non-Membership Proofs, Equality/Inequality Proofs, Sum/Product Proofs:** These are fundamental building blocks for more complex ZKP applications and are crucial for privacy-preserving computations and data verification.

// The implementation below provides outlines and conceptual structures.  Real-world cryptographic implementations would require robust cryptographic libraries, careful parameter selection, and rigorous security analysis.

**Explanation and Advanced Concepts Demonstrated:**

1.  **Pedersen Commitment Scheme:** The `Commit` and `Decommit` functions implement a basic Pedersen commitment. This is a fundamental building block for many ZKPs due to its homomorphic properties and binding/hiding nature.

2.  **Range Proof (Conceptual `ProveRange`, `VerifyRange`):**  Range proofs are crucial for scenarios where you need to prove a value is within a specific range without revealing the exact value. Examples: age verification, credit score verification, financial transactions within limits.  The code outlines the concept; a real implementation would use advanced techniques like Bulletproofs or similar.

3.  **Membership and Non-Membership Proofs (`ProveMembership`, `VerifyMembership`, `ProveNonMembership`, `VerifyNonMembership`):** These are essential for proving an element belongs to or does not belong to a set without revealing the element or the entire set. Applications: access control, whitelisting/blacklisting, anonymous voting.  Conceptual outlines are provided; real implementations would involve Merkle Trees, accumulator-based proofs, or similar techniques.

4.  **Equality and Inequality Proofs (`ProveEquality`, `VerifyEquality`, `ProveInequality`, `VerifyInequality`):** Proving whether two committed values are the same or different is fundamental for various ZKP protocols. Examples: verifying consistent data across systems, ensuring uniqueness in auctions.  Conceptual outlines are given; real implementations use sigma protocols and Fiat-Shamir transforms.

5.  **Sum and Product Proofs (`ProveSum`, `VerifySum`, `ProveProduct`, `VerifyProduct`):** These demonstrate proofs about arithmetic relationships between committed values. Sum proofs are easier due to the homomorphic property of Pedersen commitments. Product proofs are more complex and often require advanced ZKP techniques.  Applications: verifiable computation, secure multi-party computation.

6.  **Predicate Proofs (`ProvePredicate`, `VerifyPredicate`):** This is a more advanced concept. It aims to create proofs for complex logical statements involving multiple secrets and conditions.  This allows for building more expressive ZKP systems. The example is very basic, but it points towards the idea of combining simpler proofs (range, membership, etc.) to prove more complex predicates.

7.  **Anonymous Credentials (`GenerateAnonymousCredential`, `VerifyAnonymousCredential`):** This is a trendy and practical application of ZKPs. Anonymous credentials allow users to prove attributes about themselves (e.g., age, qualifications) without revealing the actual attribute values. This is crucial for privacy-preserving authentication and authorization.  The code provides a conceptual structure for generating and verifying such credentials based on policies.

8.  **Conditional Disclosure Proofs (`ProveConditionalDisclosure`, `VerifyConditionalDisclosure`):** This concept allows revealing a secret *only if* a certain condition is met, and provides a proof of this conditional disclosure. This is useful for scenarios where data should only be revealed under specific circumstances.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Placeholder Implementations:** The code provided is *conceptual* and uses placeholder implementations for the proof logic and verification.  **It is not cryptographically secure in its current form.**  Real-world ZKP implementations require rigorous cryptographic protocols and libraries.
*   **Simplified Group Setup:** The `Setup()` function uses a simplified (and insecure for production) method for setting up group parameters. In a real system, you would use a well-established elliptic curve group (like Curve25519, secp256k1) and proper generator selection.
*   **Focus on Concepts:** The primary goal of this code is to illustrate the *types* of advanced ZKP functions and how they could be structured in Go. Implementing fully secure and efficient ZKP protocols is a complex task that goes beyond the scope of this example.
*   **Real-World Libraries:** For production-ready ZKP systems, you would use specialized cryptographic libraries that provide secure and efficient implementations of ZKP protocols (e.g., libraries for Bulletproofs, zk-SNARKs/STARKs, etc.).

This comprehensive outline and conceptual code should give you a strong foundation for understanding and exploring advanced Zero-Knowledge Proof concepts in Go. Remember to replace the placeholder implementations with robust cryptographic protocols and libraries for real-world applications.
