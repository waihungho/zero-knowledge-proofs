# Zero-Knowledge Proof Library in Go: "ZkSphere"

## Outline and Function Summary

**Core ZKP Protocols:**

1.  **SchnorrZKProof(secretKey, publicKey, message) (proof, err):**  Implements the Schnorr identification protocol for zero-knowledge proof of knowledge of a discrete logarithm.  *Summary: Provides a foundational ZKP for proving knowledge of a secret key corresponding to a public key, without revealing the secret key itself.  Focuses on efficiency and simplicity.*

2.  **PedersenCommitment(value, blindingFactor) (commitment, decommitment, err):**  Generates a Pedersen commitment for a given value and blinding factor. *Summary:  Offers a homomorphic commitment scheme, allowing for commitments that can be added together while maintaining zero-knowledge properties. Useful for secure multi-party computation and range proofs.*

3.  **RangeProofBulletproofs(value, min, max, commitment, decommitment) (proof, err):**  Implements Bulletproofs for efficient zero-knowledge range proofs. *Summary:  Enables proving that a committed value lies within a specified range without revealing the exact value. Highly efficient and optimized for blockchain applications.*

4.  **SetMembershipProof(element, set, commitment, decommitment) (proof, err):** Creates a zero-knowledge proof that an element belongs to a set without revealing the element or the set itself directly. *Summary:  Allows proving membership in a collection of items privately, useful for access control and anonymous credentials.*

5.  **PolynomialEvaluationProof(polynomialCoefficients, point, evaluation, commitment, decommitment) (proof, err):**  Provides a ZKP that a polynomial, evaluated at a specific point, results in a given value, without revealing the polynomial coefficients. *Summary:  Enables proving correct polynomial computation, a building block for more advanced ZK-SNARKs and STARKs.*

6.  **SigmaProtocolSumOfSquares(secrets, publicValues, commitments, decommitments) (proof, err):**  A Sigma protocol variation for proving knowledge of multiple secrets whose squares sum up to known public values, without revealing individual secrets. *Summary:  Demonstrates a more complex Sigma protocol, suitable for scenarios requiring proofs about aggregated values without revealing individual components.*

7.  **ZKProofOfShuffle(inputList, shuffledList, permutationCommitments, permutationDecommitments) (proof, err):**  Proves in zero-knowledge that `shuffledList` is a valid shuffle of `inputList` without revealing the permutation. *Summary:  Essential for applications like anonymous voting or verifiable mixnets where shuffling needs to be proven while maintaining privacy.*

8.  **GraphNonIsomorphismProof(graph1, graph2, witnessData) (proof, err):**  Implements a zero-knowledge proof of non-isomorphism between two graphs, without revealing why they are not isomorphic. *Summary:  Tackles a more complex graph-theoretic problem in ZKP, useful for proving distinctness of structured data without revealing the distinguishing features.*

9.  **CircuitSatisfiabilityZKProof(circuitDescription, assignment, publicInputs) (proof, err):**  General circuit satisfiability proof using a custom-designed efficient approach (not R1CS directly, but something optimized for Go). *Summary:  Offers a more general ZKP framework for proving any NP statement represented as a circuit, providing flexibility for diverse applications.*

10. **RecursiveZKProofAggregation(proofsToAggregate, aggregationParameters) (aggregatedProof, err):**  Allows recursively aggregating multiple ZK proofs into a single, smaller proof, enhancing efficiency for systems with numerous proofs. *Summary:  Addresses scalability by enabling proof aggregation, crucial for blockchain and high-volume ZKP scenarios.*


**Advanced Applications & Trendy Functions:**

11. **PrivateDataAggregationZKProof(privateDatasets, aggregationFunction, publicResult, aggregationParameters) (proof, err):**  Proves that an `aggregationFunction` (e.g., sum, average) applied to multiple `privateDatasets` results in `publicResult`, without revealing individual datasets. *Summary:  Enables privacy-preserving data analysis and collaborative computation by proving aggregate results without disclosing raw data.*

12. **ZKMLInferenceVerification(machineLearningModel, inputData, predictedOutput, modelCommitment, inputCommitment) (proof, err):**  Provides a zero-knowledge proof that a given `predictedOutput` is the correct inference result of applying a `machineLearningModel` to `inputData`, without revealing the model or input in detail. *Summary:  Addresses privacy in machine learning by allowing verification of model outputs without exposing sensitive models or input data.*

13. **AnonymousCredentialIssuance(attributes, issuerPrivateKey, credentialRequest, issuerPublicKey) (anonymousCredential, proof, err):**  Implements a system for issuing anonymous credentials based on attributes, allowing users to prove possession of certain attributes without revealing their identity. *Summary:  Supports privacy-preserving digital identity and verifiable credentials while maintaining user anonymity.*

14. **PrivateSmartContractExecutionProof(contractCode, privateInputs, publicOutputs, executionTraceCommitment) (proof, err):**  Proves the correct execution of a smart contract with private inputs, resulting in specific public outputs, without revealing the private inputs or the full execution trace. *Summary:  Brings zero-knowledge to smart contracts, enabling confidential computation and private DeFi applications.*

15. **ZKBasedVoting(voterID, voteChoice, votingParameters, voterPrivateKey, voterPublicKey) (zkVote, proof, err):**  Implements a secure and private voting system using ZKPs, allowing voters to prove their vote is valid and counted without revealing their vote choice or voter identity (beyond eligibility). *Summary:  Applies ZKP to enhance voting security and privacy, crucial for democratic processes and secure governance.*

16. **SupplyChainProvenanceZKProof(productID, supplyChainData, certificationData, verifierPublicKey) (provenanceProof, err):**  Enables proving the provenance and certifications of a product through the supply chain without revealing sensitive supply chain details to unauthorized parties. *Summary:  Enhances supply chain transparency and trust while protecting business-sensitive information.*

17. **ZKReputationSystem(userActions, reputationScore, reputationParameters, userPrivateKey, userPublicKey) (reputationProof, err):**  Builds a zero-knowledge reputation system where users can prove their reputation score without revealing their full action history or score directly. *Summary:  Creates privacy-preserving reputation systems for online platforms and communities, mitigating privacy risks associated with traditional reputation systems.*

18. **CrossChainZKBridgeProof(sourceChainTx, targetChainParameters, bridgeContractCode, relayWitness) (bridgeProof, err):**  Provides a ZKP to facilitate secure cross-chain bridges by proving the validity of a transaction on a source chain to a target chain without revealing the full transaction details across chains. *Summary:  Addresses interoperability and security in blockchain by enabling verifiable cross-chain communication with privacy.*

19. **VerifiableRandomFunctionWithZKProof(seed, publicKey, privateKey) (vrfOutput, proof, err):**  Combines a Verifiable Random Function (VRF) with a zero-knowledge proof to demonstrate that the generated random output is indeed derived from the given seed and private key without revealing the private key itself. *Summary:  Provides provably random values with zero-knowledge guarantees, useful for fair randomness in decentralized systems and gaming.*

20. **TimeLockEncryptionWithZKProof(plaintext, unlockTime, encryptionParameters, recipientPublicKey) (ciphertext, proof, err):**  Implements time-lock encryption where data remains encrypted until a specific time, combined with a ZKP to prove that the encryption is correctly set up with the given time lock without revealing the plaintext itself before the unlock time. *Summary:  Combines time-lock cryptography with ZKP for secure and time-sensitive data release scenarios.*
