Package zkpvoting - Zero-Knowledge Proof for Verifiable and Private Voting System

Outline and Function Summary:

This package implements a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) system for a verifiable and private voting system.
It goes beyond simple demonstrations and aims to showcase advanced concepts and creative applications of ZKPs in a practical scenario.

The core idea is to allow voters to cast votes and election authorities to tally them, all while ensuring:

1. **Privacy:** Voters' individual choices are not revealed.
2. **Verifiability:**  Everyone can verify that the election outcome is computed correctly based on valid votes.
3. **Integrity:**  Votes cannot be altered or forged.
4. **Eligibility:** Only authorized voters can participate.
5. **Non-reusability:** Each voter can vote only once.

This is achieved through a suite of ZKP protocols tailored for different aspects of the voting process.

Function Summary (20+ Functions):

**1. Setup and Key Generation (Election Authority Side):**

   - `SetupElectionParameters(numCandidates int, authorizedVoters []VoterID) (*ElectionParameters, error)`:
     - Generates global parameters for the election, including cryptographic parameters and election-specific settings.
     - Input: Number of candidates, list of authorized voter IDs.
     - Output: Election parameters object, error if any.

   - `GenerateAuthorityKeyPair() (*AuthorityPrivateKey, *AuthorityPublicKey, error)`:
     - Election authority generates its own public and private key pair, used for signing and other authority-specific operations.
     - Output: Authority private key, authority public key, error if any.

   - `GenerateVoterRegistrationSecret(voterID VoterID) (*VoterRegistrationSecret, error)`:
     - Generates a unique secret for each authorized voter, used for registration and anonymous authentication.
     - Input: Voter ID.
     - Output: Voter registration secret, error if any.

   - `PublishElectionParameters(params *ElectionParameters, authorityPublicKey *AuthorityPublicKey) error`:
     - Publishes election parameters and authority public key to a public bulletin board or distributed ledger.
     - Input: Election parameters, authority public key.
     - Output: Error if publishing fails.

**2. Voter Registration and Anonymous Authentication (Voter Side & Authority Side):**

   - `VoterGenerateRegistrationRequest(voterID VoterID, registrationSecret *VoterRegistrationSecret) (*RegistrationRequest, error)`:
     - Voter generates a registration request using their secret, committing to their identity without revealing it directly. (Uses commitment schemes and ZKPs).
     - Input: Voter ID, registration secret.
     - Output: Registration request, error if any.

   - `AuthorityVerifyRegistrationRequest(request *RegistrationRequest, authorityPrivateKey *AuthorityPrivateKey, electionParams *ElectionParameters) (*RegistrationResponse, error)`:
     - Authority verifies the registration request (using ZKP to ensure validity without revealing the voter's secret) and issues a signed registration response.
     - Input: Registration request, authority private key, election parameters.
     - Output: Registration response (signed credentials), error if any.

   - `VoterVerifyRegistrationResponse(response *RegistrationResponse, authorityPublicKey *AuthorityPublicKey, electionParams *ElectionParameters) (*VoterCredentials, error)`:
     - Voter verifies the authority's signature on the registration response and obtains verifiable voter credentials.
     - Input: Registration response, authority public key, election parameters.
     - Output: Voter credentials, error if any.

**3. Vote Casting (Voter Side):**

   - `VoterPrepareVote(credentials *VoterCredentials, voteChoice int, electionParams *ElectionParameters) (*EncryptedVote, *VoteCommitment, error)`:
     - Voter prepares their vote (encrypted and committed) in a way that preserves privacy but allows for verification later. (Uses homomorphic encryption and commitment schemes).
     - Input: Voter credentials, vote choice (candidate index), election parameters.
     - Output: Encrypted vote, vote commitment, error if any.

   - `VoterGenerateVoteProof(credentials *VoterCredentials, encryptedVote *EncryptedVote, voteCommitment *VoteCommitment, voteChoice int, electionParams *ElectionParameters) (*VoteProof, error)`:
     - Voter generates a Zero-Knowledge Proof demonstrating that the encrypted vote and commitment are correctly formed and correspond to a valid vote choice, *without revealing the choice itself*.  This is a core ZKP function using techniques like Schnorr proofs or Bulletproofs adapted for voting.
     - Input: Voter credentials, encrypted vote, vote commitment, vote choice, election parameters.
     - Output: Vote proof, error if any.

   - `SubmitVote(encryptedVote *EncryptedVote, voteCommitment *VoteCommitment, voteProof *VoteProof, voterCredentials *VoterCredentials) error`:
     - Voter submits the encrypted vote, commitment, and proof to the bulletin board.  Includes mechanism to prevent double voting.
     - Input: Encrypted vote, vote commitment, vote proof, voter credentials.
     - Output: Error if submission fails (e.g., double voting attempt).

**4. Vote Verification (Public/Anyone can verify):**

   - `VerifyVoteProof(encryptedVote *EncryptedVote, voteCommitment *VoteCommitment, voteProof *VoteProof, voterCredentials *VoterCredentials, electionParams *ElectionParameters, authorityPublicKey *AuthorityPublicKey) (bool, error)`:
     - Verifies the Zero-Knowledge Proof associated with a submitted vote. This confirms that the vote is valid, correctly formed, and cast by an authorized voter, *without revealing the vote choice*.
     - Input: Encrypted vote, vote commitment, vote proof, voter credentials, election parameters, authority public key.
     - Output: Boolean indicating proof validity, error if any.

   - `VerifyVoterCredentials(credentials *VoterCredentials, authorityPublicKey *AuthorityPublicKey, electionParams *ElectionParameters) (bool, error)`:
     - Verifies the voter credentials provided with the vote, ensuring they are valid and issued by the authority.
     - Input: Voter credentials, authority public key, election parameters.
     - Output: Boolean indicating credential validity, error if any.

   - `CheckVoteCommitmentUniqueness(voteCommitment *VoteCommitment) (bool, error)`:
     - Checks if the vote commitment has been used before to prevent double voting.  Queries a bulletin board or storage.
     - Input: Vote commitment.
     - Output: Boolean indicating uniqueness, error if any.

**5. Vote Tallying (Election Authority Side):**

   - `TallyVotes(encryptedVotes []*EncryptedVote, electionParams *ElectionParameters, authorityPrivateKey *AuthorityPrivateKey) (*VoteTally, error)`:
     - Election authority tallies the encrypted votes using homomorphic properties.  The tally is still encrypted but allows determining the vote counts for each candidate.
     - Input: List of encrypted votes, election parameters, authority private key (for decryption if needed for tallying).
     - Output: Encrypted vote tally, error if any.

   - `GenerateTallyProof(encryptedTally *VoteTally, encryptedVotes []*EncryptedVote, electionParams *ElectionParameters, authorityPrivateKey *AuthorityPrivateKey) (*TallyProof, error)`:
     - Authority generates a Zero-Knowledge Proof that the tally is computed correctly from the submitted encrypted votes.  This is a *proof of correct computation*.
     - Input: Encrypted tally, list of encrypted votes, election parameters, authority private key.
     - Output: Tally proof, error if any.

   - `PublishEncryptedTallyAndProof(encryptedTally *VoteTally, tallyProof *TallyProof) error`:
     - Authority publishes the encrypted tally and the tally proof to the bulletin board.
     - Input: Encrypted tally, tally proof.
     - Output: Error if publishing fails.

**6. Tally Verification and Decryption (Public/Anyone can verify):**

   - `VerifyTallyProof(encryptedTally *VoteTally, tallyProof *TallyProof, encryptedVotes []*EncryptedVote, electionParams *ElectionParameters, authorityPublicKey *AuthorityPublicKey) (bool, error)`:
     - Anyone can verify the tally proof, ensuring that the published tally is indeed the correct aggregation of the submitted encrypted votes.
     - Input: Encrypted tally, tally proof, list of encrypted votes, election parameters, authority public key.
     - Output: Boolean indicating tally proof validity, error if any.

   - `DecryptTally(encryptedTally *VoteTally, authorityPrivateKey *AuthorityPrivateKey) (*FinalTally, error)`:
     - (Only the authority with the private key can decrypt the final tally to reveal the election outcome). Authority decrypts the encrypted tally to get the final vote counts for each candidate.
     - Input: Encrypted tally, authority private key.
     - Output: Final tally (vote counts per candidate), error if any.

   - `PublishFinalTally(finalTally *FinalTally, authorityPublicKey *AuthorityPublicKey, electionParams *ElectionParameters) error`:
     - Authority publishes the final decrypted tally, signed for authenticity, to the bulletin board.
     - Input: Final tally, authority public key, election parameters.
     - Output: Error if publishing fails.

**7. Audit and Transparency (Public/Anyone can audit):**

   - `AuditElection(electionParams *ElectionParameters) error`:
     - Provides a function to audit the entire election process. This would involve verifying all published data: election parameters, voter credentials, vote proofs, tally proof, and final tally.  Ensures transparency and accountability.
     - Input: Election parameters.
     - Output: Error if audit fails at any stage (e.g., invalid proof, inconsistent data).

**Data Structures (Conceptual - Implement as needed):**

- `ElectionParameters`: Stores global election settings, cryptographic parameters, list of candidates, etc.
- `AuthorityPrivateKey`, `AuthorityPublicKey`: Key pair for the election authority.
- `VoterID`: Type for voter identifiers (e.g., string, hash).
- `VoterRegistrationSecret`: Secret key for voter registration.
- `RegistrationRequest`, `RegistrationResponse`: Data structures for registration process.
- `VoterCredentials`: Verifiable credentials issued to registered voters.
- `EncryptedVote`: Encrypted representation of a vote.
- `VoteCommitment`: Commitment to a vote (used for non-reusability and linking).
- `VoteProof`: Zero-Knowledge Proof of vote validity.
- `VoteTally`: Encrypted tally of votes.
- `TallyProof`: Zero-Knowledge Proof of correct tally computation.
- `FinalTally`: Decrypted vote counts per candidate.


**Note:** This is an outline and function summary.  The actual implementation would require choosing specific cryptographic primitives (e.g., commitment schemes, homomorphic encryption, ZKP protocols), implementing the data structures, and handling error cases. The focus here is on the conceptual design and the breadth of ZKP applications within a voting system, aiming for more than 20 distinct functions that showcase advanced concepts.
