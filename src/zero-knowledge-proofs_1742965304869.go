Note: This code provides conceptual outlines and function signatures. Actual cryptographic implementations for each function would require robust cryptographic libraries (like `crypto/elliptic`, `crypto/rand`, potentially external libraries for advanced ZKP schemes) and careful security considerations.  This example focuses on demonstrating the *variety* and *advanced concepts* of ZKP applications rather than providing production-ready cryptographic code.  Error handling and more detailed cryptographic logic are simplified for clarity of demonstration.  For real-world usage, consult with cryptography experts and use established, audited cryptographic libraries.
