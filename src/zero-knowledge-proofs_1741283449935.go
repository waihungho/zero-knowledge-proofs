/*
Outline and Function Summary:

This Go package provides a collection of Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) functions focusing on advanced, creative, and trendy applications beyond basic demonstrations.  These functions are designed to be conceptual blueprints and would require significant cryptographic implementation for real-world use.  The goal is to showcase the potential of ZKP in various modern scenarios.

Function Summary:

1.  ProveReputationScoreAboveThreshold(reputation, threshold, commitmentKey): Proves that a reputation score is above a certain threshold without revealing the exact score. Uses commitment schemes and range proofs conceptually.

2.  ProveAgeOver18WithoutDOB(dateOfBirthCommitment, commitmentKey, currentDate): Proves that a person is over 18 years old without revealing their exact date of birth, given a commitment to their DOB.  Involves date calculations within ZKP.

3.  ProveLocationWithinRadiusWithoutExactLocation(locationCommitment, commitmentKey, centerLocation, radius): Proves that a user's location is within a certain radius of a given center point without revealing their precise coordinates. Geometric calculations within ZKP.

4.  ProveSalaryWithinRangeWithoutExactSalary(salaryCommitment, commitmentKey, minSalary, maxSalary): Proves that a salary falls within a specified range (e.g., for loan eligibility) without revealing the exact salary. Range proofs.

5.  ProveCreditScoreAboveMinimumWithoutExactScore(creditScoreCommitment, commitmentKey, minimumScore): Proves a credit score is above a minimum requirement without disclosing the precise score. Range proofs.

6.  ProveTransactionValueAboveThresholdWithoutExactValue(transactionValueCommitment, commitmentKey, threshold): Proves that a transaction value is greater than a certain threshold without revealing the exact transaction amount. Range proofs.

7.  ProveOwnershipOfDigitalAssetWithoutWalletAddress(assetCommitment, commitmentKey, assetIdentifier): Proves ownership of a digital asset (like an NFT) identified by `assetIdentifier` without revealing the wallet address holding it. Commitment and potentially signature-based ZKP.

8.  ProveMembershipInExclusiveGroupWithoutIdentity(groupIdentifier, groupMembershipCommitment, commitmentKey): Proves membership in an exclusive group identified by `groupIdentifier` without revealing the user's identity or specific membership details. Membership proofs.

9.  ProveDataIntegrityWithoutRevealingData(dataHashCommitment, commitmentKey, originalDataHash): Proves the integrity of data by showing that a commitment corresponds to a specific hash of the original data, without revealing the data itself. Hash commitment and equality proofs.

10. ProveCorrectComputationOfFunctionWithoutInputsOrOutputs(programCommitment, inputOutputRelationCommitment, commitmentKey):  A highly abstract function to prove that a certain program was executed correctly based on a committed relationship between inputs and outputs, without revealing the program, inputs, or outputs directly.  This is conceptually similar to zk-SNARKs/STARKs but in a simplified illustration.

11. ProveKnowledgeOfPasswordHashWithoutRevealingPassword(passwordHashCommitment, commitmentKey, salt): Proves knowledge of a password that hashes to a given committed hash (using a salt) without revealing the actual password. Commitment to password and hash function application within ZKP.

12. ProveAbsenceFromBlacklistWithoutRevealingIdentifier(identifierCommitment, commitmentKey, blacklistCommitment): Proves that a user's identifier is not on a committed blacklist without revealing the identifier itself or the entire blacklist. Non-membership proofs and commitment schemes.

13. ProveEligibilityForServiceWithoutRevealingCriteria(eligibilityCriteriaCommitment, commitmentKey, proofOfMeetingCriteria): Proves that a user meets certain (unrevealed) eligibility criteria for a service based on a pre-computed proof, without exposing the criteria themselves. Proof verification against commitment.

14. ProveRandomnessOfNumberWithoutRevealingNumber(randomNumberCommitment, commitmentKey): Proves that a committed number was generated randomly without revealing the number itself. Statistical property proofs.

15. ProveFairnessOfSelectionProcessWithoutRevealingSelectionDetails(selectionProcessCommitment, commitmentKey, selectedIndexProof): Proves that a selection process (e.g., choosing a lottery winner) was fair and unbiased without revealing the entire set of participants or the selection algorithm, only the proof of fairness for the selected index. Algorithmic fairness proofs in ZKP.

16. ProveAnonymityInVotingWithoutRevealingVote(voteCommitment, commitmentKey, ballotBoxCommitment): In the context of anonymous voting, proves that a vote was cast and correctly recorded in a committed ballot box without linking the vote to the voter's identity.  Vote privacy proofs.

17. ProveNoDoubleSpendingInDigitalCurrencyWithoutTransactionDetails(transactionCommitment, commitmentKey, blockchainStateCommitment): In a digital currency context, proves that a transaction is not a double-spending attempt by referencing a committed blockchain state, without revealing the transaction details or the entire blockchain. Transaction validity proofs.

18. ProveComplianceWithRegulationsWithoutRevealingData(regulatoryComplianceCommitment, commitmentKey, dataRelevantToRegulation): Proves compliance with certain regulations (e.g., data privacy regulations) without revealing the specific data being regulated, only a proof of compliance based on a commitment to the relevant data. Regulatory compliance proofs.

19. ProveStatisticalPropertyOfDatasetWithoutRevealingDataset(datasetHashCommitment, commitmentKey, statisticalPropertyProof): Proves a specific statistical property of a dataset (e.g., average value within a range, variance) without revealing the dataset itself, only a commitment to its hash and a proof of the property. Privacy-preserving statistical analysis in ZKP.

20. ProveCorrectnessOfMachineLearningInferenceWithoutRevealingModelOrData(modelCommitment, inputCommitment, outputCommitment, inferenceCorrectnessProof): A highly advanced concept: Proves that a machine learning inference was performed correctly using a committed model and input, resulting in the committed output, without revealing the model, input, or output directly.  This is in the realm of privacy-preserving ML inference using ZKP.

Each of these functions is a conceptual starting point and would require significant cryptographic engineering to implement securely and efficiently. They represent advanced applications of Zero-Knowledge Proofs in diverse and trendy domains.
