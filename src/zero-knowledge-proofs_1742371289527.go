Outline and Function Summary:

Package zkplib provides a collection of Zero-Knowledge Proof functions in Golang, focusing on advanced concepts, creative applications, and avoiding duplication of common open-source examples.

Function Summary (20+ Functions):

Core ZKP Primitives:

1.  CommitmentScheme: Implements a cryptographic commitment scheme (e.g., Pedersen Commitment).
    - Allows a prover to commit to a value without revealing it, and later reveal it and prove the commitment was made to that value.

2.  ZeroKnowledgeProofOfKnowledge: Generates a ZKP that the prover knows a secret value without revealing the value itself. (e.g., Schnorr Proof)
    - Proves knowledge of a secret (like a private key) related to a public value without revealing the secret.

3.  RangeProof: Creates a ZKP that a number lies within a specific range without revealing the number itself. (e.g., Bulletproofs inspired simplified version).
    - Proves that a secret number is within a given minimum and maximum value without disclosing the number.

4.  EqualityProof: Generates a ZKP that two committed values are equal without revealing the values.
    - Proves that two separately committed values are the same underlying secret value.

5.  MembershipProof:  Creates a ZKP that a value belongs to a predefined set without revealing the value.
    - Proves that a secret value is a member of a public set of values without revealing which one it is.

6.  NonMembershipProof: Creates a ZKP that a value does NOT belong to a predefined set without revealing the value.
    - Proves that a secret value is *not* a member of a public set of values without revealing the secret.

7.  SetIntersectionProof:  Proves that two sets (one private, one public) have a non-empty intersection without revealing the intersection itself or the private set entirely.
    - Proves that a private set and a public set have at least one element in common, without revealing the common elements or the entire private set.

8.  SetInclusionProof: Proves that one private set is a subset of a public set, without revealing the private set itself.
    - Proves that all elements of a private set are also present in a public set, without revealing the private set.

9.  HomomorphicCommitment:  Implements a homomorphic commitment scheme allowing operations on committed values without decommitment. (e.g., additive homomorphism)
    - Allows performing operations (like addition) on committed values and obtaining a commitment to the result, without revealing the original values.

Advanced and Creative ZKP Applications:

10. AgeVerificationProof:  Proves that a person is above a certain age without revealing their exact age.
    - Uses ZKP to verify that a secret age is greater than or equal to a public age threshold.

11. LocationProximityProof:  Proves that two users are within a certain geographical proximity without revealing their exact locations.
    - Proves that two users' private locations are within a specified distance of each other, without revealing the exact locations.

12. CreditScoreRangeProof: Proves that a credit score falls within an acceptable range without revealing the exact score.
    - Proves that a secret credit score is within a given acceptable range (e.g., "good" range) without revealing the precise score.

13. MedicalConditionProof: Proves that a person has a specific medical condition (or doesn't) without revealing the condition itself (e.g., only proving "has condition X").
    - Proves the presence or absence of a specific medical condition (represented by a secret value) without revealing the condition itself.

14. SoftwareLicenseProof: Proves that a user has a valid software license without revealing the license key itself.
    - Proves possession of a valid software license (represented by a secret key) without revealing the key.

15. FileIntegrityProof: Proves the integrity of a file (that it hasn't been tampered with) without revealing the file content.
    - Proves that a file's hash matches a known hash, confirming integrity without revealing the file.

16. ProductOriginProof: Proves the origin of a product (e.g., manufactured in a specific country) without revealing the entire supply chain details.
    - Proves a specific attribute of a product's origin (e.g., country of manufacture) without revealing the entire manufacturing process.

17. BiometricAuthenticationProof: Proves biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint match) without revealing the raw biometric data.
    - Proves successful biometric authentication based on a secret biometric template without revealing the template itself.

18. SecureVotingProof: Proves that a vote was cast and counted without revealing the voter's identity or the vote itself to unauthorized parties. (Simplified voting scenario)
    - In a simplified voting system, proves that a vote was cast and included in the tally without revealing the voter's identity or the vote value to verifiers (only to authorized tally counters in a real system which is more complex).

19. AIModelIntegrityProof:  Proves that an AI model is the original, untampered model without revealing the model's architecture or weights. (Simplified model hash check)
    - Proves that an AI model's hash matches a known hash of the original model, ensuring integrity without revealing model details.

20. DataPrivacyComplianceProof: Proves compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) without revealing the raw data being assessed for compliance.
    - Proves that data satisfies certain privacy constraints (e.g., anonymization criteria) without revealing the data itself.

21. AnonymousCredentialProof: Proves possession of a credential (e.g., membership in a group) without revealing the specific credential or identity.
    - Proves that the prover possesses a valid credential (represented by a secret) granting them certain rights, without revealing the credential itself or linking it to a specific identity.

Note: These function outlines are conceptual. Actual implementation of robust ZKP systems requires careful cryptographic design, handling of security parameters, and considerations for efficiency and security against various attacks.  This code provides function signatures and conceptual implementations as placeholders to illustrate the requested functionality.
