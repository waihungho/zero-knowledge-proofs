Outline and Function Summary:

This Golang code implements a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) system for a "Secure Collaborative Data Averaging" scenario.
Imagine multiple parties each holding private numerical data. They want to collaboratively compute the average of their data *without* revealing their individual data to each other or a central aggregator.
This system uses ZKP to ensure that each participant contributes valid data within a pre-defined range and that the final average is correctly computed from these valid contributions, all while maintaining data privacy.

The system is built around a set of functions covering:

1. Setup Phase:
    - `GeneratePublicParameters()`: Generates public parameters for the ZKP system (simulated here).
    - `GenerateKeyPair()`: Generates a key pair for each participant (simulated here).

2. Data Preparation and Commitment:
    - `CommitToData(data float64, publicKey string)`:  A participant commits to their private data using their public key. This hides the data but allows later proof of its properties. (Simulated commitment for demonstration).
    - `DataToScalar(data float64)`:  Converts numerical data to a scalar representation suitable for ZKP operations (simulated).
    - `GenerateRandomScalar()`: Generates a random scalar value for cryptographic operations (simulated).
    - `ScalarMultiply(scalar float64, base float64)`: Performs scalar multiplication (simulated).

3. Proof Generation (Participant Side):
    - `GenerateRangeProof(data float64, minRange float64, maxRange float64, privateKey string, publicParams string)`: Generates a ZKP that the committed data is within a specified range [minRange, maxRange] without revealing the data itself.
    - `GenerateSumContributionProof(data float64, commitment string, publicParams string, privateKey string, aggregatedCommitment string)`: Generates a ZKP that the participant's data was correctly included in the aggregated commitment (used for sum calculation).
    - `GenerateKnowledgeOfDataProof(data float64, commitment string, publicParams string, privateKey string)`: Generates a ZKP proving knowledge of the data corresponding to a given commitment.
    - `GenerateConsistentCommitmentProof(data1 float64, commitment1 string, data2 float64, commitment2 string, publicParams string, privateKey string)`: Generates a ZKP that two commitments are consistent with the same underlying data (or related data based on some known relationship).
    - `GenerateNonNegativeProof(data float64, commitment string, publicParams string, privateKey string)`: Generates a ZKP that the committed data is non-negative.
    - `GenerateIntegerProof(data float64, commitment string, publicParams string, privateKey string)`: Generates a ZKP that the committed data is an integer.

4. Proof Verification (Aggregator/Verifier Side):
    - `VerifyRangeProof(commitment string, proof string, minRange float64, maxRange float64, publicKey string, publicParams string)`: Verifies the range proof, ensuring the data is within the specified range.
    - `VerifySumContributionProof(commitment string, proof string, publicKey string, publicParams string, aggregatedCommitment string, participantPublicKey string)`: Verifies the sum contribution proof.
    - `VerifyKnowledgeOfDataProof(commitment string, proof string, publicKey string, publicParams string)`: Verifies the knowledge of data proof.
    - `VerifyConsistentCommitmentProof(commitment1 string, commitmentProof string, commitment2 string, publicKey string, publicParams string)`: Verifies the consistent commitment proof.
    - `VerifyNonNegativeProof(commitment string, proof string, publicKey string, publicParams string)`: Verifies the non-negative proof.
    - `VerifyIntegerProof(commitment string, proof string, publicKey string, publicParams string)`: Verifies the integer proof.
    - `AggregateCommitments(commitments []string, publicParams string)`: Aggregates individual data commitments into a single commitment representing the sum (simulated aggregation).
    - `ExtractAverageFromAggregatedCommitment(aggregatedCommitment string, numParticipants int, publicParams string)`: Extracts the average from the aggregated commitment and the number of participants (simulated extraction).
    - `VerifyAggregatedAverage(aggregatedAverage float64, individualCommitments []string, proofs []string, publicParams string, publicKeys []string, minRange float64, maxRange float64)`:  A high-level function to verify the entire process: that individual data is in range, commitments are valid, and the final average is correct based on verified commitments.

Important Notes:

- **Simulation, Not Real Crypto:** This code is a high-level demonstration and *does not* implement actual secure cryptographic ZKP algorithms.  It uses simplified placeholder functions and string manipulations to represent cryptographic operations. A real ZKP system would require using established cryptographic libraries and algorithms (like zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs, etc.) for security.
- **Conceptual Focus:** The focus is on demonstrating the *flow* and *types* of functions involved in a ZKP-based secure computation scenario, showcasing advanced concepts and creative function design.
- **No External Libraries:** To keep the example self-contained and focused on the logic, it avoids external cryptographic libraries. In a production system, these would be essential.
- **Scalability and Efficiency:** This simplified example does not address scalability or efficiency concerns that are crucial in real-world ZKP applications. Real ZKP systems often involve complex optimizations for performance.

This example provides a foundation for understanding how ZKP can be applied to privacy-preserving data aggregation and demonstrates a range of functions that can be part of a more comprehensive ZKP system.

**Explanation of Functions and ZKP Concepts Demonstrated:**

1.  **Setup Phase:**
    *   `GeneratePublicParameters()`: In real ZKP systems, public parameters are crucial for defining the cryptographic environment and ensuring interoperability. They are often fixed and well-known for a given ZKP scheme.
    *   `GenerateKeyPair()`:  Each participant needs a public/private key pair. Public keys are shared, while private keys are kept secret and used for proof generation.

2.  **Data Preparation and Commitment:**
    *   `CommitToData()`:  Commitment is a fundamental ZKP building block. It allows a participant to "lock in" their data without revealing it.  Later, they can "open" the commitment to prove properties about the committed data.
    *   `DataToScalar()`, `GenerateRandomScalar()`, `ScalarMultiply()`: These functions are placeholders for cryptographic operations that would be performed in a real ZKP system. ZKP often works with mathematical structures like finite fields or elliptic curves, where data needs to be represented as scalars and operations are performed on these scalars.

3.  **Proof Generation (Participant Side):**
    *   `GenerateRangeProof()`:  **Range Proofs** are a common and important ZKP type. They prove that a committed value lies within a specific range without revealing the exact value. This is useful for enforcing constraints on data without disclosing it.
    *   `GenerateSumContributionProof()`: This demonstrates a more specific ZKP for collaborative computation. It aims to prove that a participant's data was correctly included in an aggregated sum (or commitment representing the sum).  This is essential for ensuring the integrity of collaborative calculations.
    *   `GenerateKnowledgeOfDataProof()`:  **Proof of Knowledge** is a basic ZKP type that proves that a prover knows a secret value (in this case, the original data) associated with a commitment.
    *   `GenerateConsistentCommitmentProof()`: This shows how ZKP can prove relationships between commitments. In this case, it proves that two commitments are consistent with the same (or related) underlying data. This is useful for ensuring data integrity and consistency across multiple steps of a process.
    *   `GenerateNonNegativeProof()`, `GenerateIntegerProof()`: These are examples of property proofs, demonstrating that ZKP can be used to prove specific properties of the committed data (non-negativity, being an integer) without revealing the data itself.

4.  **Proof Verification (Aggregator/Verifier Side):**
    *   `VerifyRangeProof()`, `VerifySumContributionProof()`, `VerifyKnowledgeOfDataProof()`, `VerifyConsistentCommitmentProof()`, `VerifyNonNegativeProof()`, `VerifyIntegerProof()`: These functions simulate the verification process. In a real ZKP system, these functions would use cryptographic algorithms to check the validity of the proofs against the commitments, public keys, and public parameters. The key aspect of ZKP verification is that it should be efficient and *only* reveal whether the proof is valid or not, without revealing any information about the secret data itself.

5.  **Aggregation and Average Calculation:**
    *   `AggregateCommitments()`:  In some ZKP schemes (especially those with homomorphic properties), commitments can be aggregated (e.g., added together) in a way that corresponds to the aggregation of the underlying data. This function simulates this aggregation process.
    *   `ExtractAverageFromAggregatedCommitment()`:  This is a highly simplified simulation of how the result of the computation (the average in this case) might be extracted from the aggregated commitment. In reality, this process would depend heavily on the specific ZKP scheme and aggregation method used.
    *   `VerifyAggregatedAverage()`: This is a high-level function that orchestrates the entire verification process. It checks the individual range proofs and then performs a (simplified) verification of the final aggregated average. In a more robust system, the average verification itself might also involve ZKP techniques to ensure its correctness.

**Key Zero-Knowledge Proof Properties Demonstrated (Conceptually):**

*   **Zero-Knowledge:** The verifier (aggregator) learns *nothing* about the actual data values of the participants, only whether their commitments and proofs are valid.
*   **Soundness:**  It's computationally infeasible for a malicious participant to generate a valid proof for false data (e.g., data outside the allowed range).
*   **Completeness:** If a participant's data is valid and within the specified range, they *can* generate a proof that the verifier will accept.

**To make this a real, secure ZKP system, you would need to:**

1.  **Replace Simulations with Real Cryptography:**  Use established cryptographic libraries and ZKP algorithms (like those mentioned in the comments) for commitment schemes, proof generation, and verification.
2.  **Choose a Specific ZKP Scheme:** Select a suitable ZKP scheme based on your security and performance requirements (e.g., zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs, etc.).
3.  **Implement Cryptographic Primitives:**  Use libraries for hashing, elliptic curve operations, finite field arithmetic, etc., as required by the chosen ZKP scheme.
4.  **Address Security Considerations:** Carefully analyze and address potential security vulnerabilities, including attacks on the cryptographic primitives and the ZKP protocols themselves.
5.  **Optimize for Performance:** Real ZKP systems can be computationally intensive. Performance optimization is often critical for practical applications.
