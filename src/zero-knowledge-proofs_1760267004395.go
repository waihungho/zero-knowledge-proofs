This Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) implementation in Golang provides a solution for a common and advanced privacy-preserving use case: **proving a secret numeric score (e.g., reputation, credit, age) falls within a public range AND is above a public minimum threshold, without revealing the exact score.**

This is not a demonstration of basic ZKP concepts. Instead, it tackles a non-trivial problem often seen in decentralized identity (DID), DeFi lending, or secure access control. The core idea is built upon:
1.  **Pedersen Commitments**: To commit to secret values.
2.  **Bit Decomposition**: To break down a secret score into its binary bits, enabling range proofs.
3.  **Zero-Knowledge Proof of OR (for bits)**: To prove each bit is either 0 or 1 without revealing which.
4.  **Zero-Knowledge Proof of Linear Combination**: To prove the committed score is correctly reconstructed from its committed bits.
5.  **Zero-Knowledge Proof for Threshold**: By proving the difference `(score - threshold)` is non-negative and within a valid range.

The combination of these techniques allows for a robust, non-interactive (using Fiat-Shamir heuristic) ZKP that doesn't rely on full-blown SNARKs/STARKs but is significantly more complex than simple "knowledge of discrete logarithm" proofs.

### **Outline and Function Summary**

#### **I. Core Cryptographic Primitives & Utilities (Elliptic Curve, Scalar, Point Operations)**
1.  `InitCurve()`: Initializes the `secp256k1` elliptic curve and its parameters.
2.  `GetGeneratorG()`: Returns the standard base generator point `G` of the curve.
3.  `GetGeneratorH()`: Returns a second, independent generator point `H` for Pedersen commitments.
4.  `ScalarRandom()`: Generates a cryptographically secure random scalar.
5.  `ScalarAdd(s1, s2 *big.Int)`: Adds two scalars modulo the curve order.
6.  `ScalarSub(s1, s2 *big.Int)`: Subtracts two scalars modulo the curve order.
7.  `ScalarMul(s1, s2 *big.Int)`: Multiplies two scalars modulo the curve order.
8.  `ScalarInverse(s *big.Int)`: Computes the modular multiplicative inverse of a scalar.
9.  `PointAdd(P1, P2 *go_ethereum_crypto_bn256.G1)`: Adds two elliptic curve points.
10. `PointScalarMul(P *go_ethereum_crypto_bn256.G1, s *big.Int)`: Multiplies an elliptic curve point by a scalar.
11. `HashToScalar(data []byte)`: Hashes arbitrary data to a scalar value modulo the curve order (used for Fiat-Shamir challenges).

#### **II. Pedersen Commitment Scheme**
12. `PedersenCommit(value, randomness *big.Int)`: Creates a Pedersen commitment `C = value*G + randomness*H`.
13. `PedersenOpen(commitment *go_ethereum_crypto_bn256.G1, value, randomness *big.Int)`: Verifies if a given commitment `C` matches `value*G + randomness*H`.

#### **III. Zero-Knowledge Proof Structures**
14. `BitProof` struct: Holds components for proving a single bit (0 or 1).

#### **IV. ZKP Components: Bit Property (0/1) Proof**
16. `ProverProveBit(bitVal, randomness *big.Int)`: Generates a ZKP that a commitment `C_bit` holds a 0 or 1, without revealing `bitVal`. This uses a variant of a Schnorr OR-proof (Chaum-Pedersen).

18. `ProverGenerateScoreThresholdProof(secretScore, maxScore, minThreshold *big.Int)`:
    *   Commits to `secretScore` and its bits.
    *   Generates `BitProof` for each bit.
    *   Computes commitments for `diff = secretScore - minThreshold` and its bits.
    *   Generates `BitProof` for each `diff` bit.
    *   Constructs the complete `ScoreThresholdProof` using Fiat-Shamir.
19. `VerifierVerifyScoreThresholdProof(commitmentS *go_ethereum_crypto_bn256.G1, maxScore, minThreshold *big.Int, proof *ScoreThresholdProof)`:
    *   Verifies the consistency of the `secretScore` commitment with its bit commitments.
    *   Verifies all individual `BitProof`s for `secretScore`.
    *   Verifies the `secretScore`'s range (0 to `maxScore`).
    *   Verifies the consistency of the `diff` commitment with its bit commitments.
    *   Verifies all individual `BitProof`s for `diff`.
    *   Verifies `diff`'s range (0 to `maxScore - minThreshold`).
    *   Returns `true` if all checks pass.

#### **VI. Utility Functions**
20. `bigIntToBytes(val *big.Int)`: Converts a `*big.Int` to a byte slice for hashing.
21. `pointToBytes(p *go_ethereum_crypto_bn256.G1)`: Converts an elliptic curve point to a byte slice.
