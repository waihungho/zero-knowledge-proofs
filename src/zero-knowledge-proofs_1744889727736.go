Outline and Function Summary:

This Go code implements a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) system for a "Verifiable Location and Age Attestation" scenario.
It allows a Prover to convince a Verifier that they are located within a specific region (e.g., Europe) and are above a certain age (e.g., 18) without revealing their exact location or age. This is achieved through a simplified, illustrative ZKP approach focusing on commitments and range proofs (conceptually).

The system is structured around the following core functionalities:

1. Setup and Key Generation:
    - GenerateRandomSalt(): Generates a random salt for cryptographic commitments.
    - HashData(data string, salt string):  Hashes data with a salt for commitment creation.

2. Credential Issuance (Simulated - for demonstration purposes):
    - IssueLocationCredential(location string, salt string): Simulates issuing a location credential by hashing the location with a salt.
    - IssueAgeCredential(age int, salt string): Simulates issuing an age credential by hashing the age with a salt.

3. Prover Functions (Proof Generation):
    - CreateLocationCommitment(location string, salt string): Creates a commitment to the prover's location.
    - CreateAgeCommitment(age int, salt string): Creates a commitment to the prover's age.
    - GenerateLocationProof(location string, salt string, region string): Generates a proof that the location is within a specified region without revealing the exact location. (Simplified conceptual range proof).
    - GenerateAgeProof(age int, salt string, minAge int): Generates a proof that the age is above a minimum age without revealing the exact age. (Simplified conceptual range proof).
    - CreateCombinedProof(locationProof LocationProof, ageProof AgeProof): Combines location and age proofs into a single proof structure.
    - RevealSaltForLocationProof(salt string, proofType ProofType):  Reveals the salt for the location proof, conditional on proof type. (Illustrative selective disclosure).
    - RevealSaltForAgeProof(salt string, proofType ProofType): Reveals the salt for the age proof, conditional on proof type. (Illustrative selective disclosure).
    - PrepareProofPayload(locationCommitment Commitment, ageCommitment Commitment, locationProof LocationProof, ageProof AgeProof, revealedSaltLocation string, revealedSaltAge string): Packages all proof components into a payload for transmission.

4. Verifier Functions (Proof Verification):
    - VerifyLocationCommitment(commitment Commitment, locationProof LocationProof, revealedSalt string, region string): Verifies the location commitment against the location proof and revealed salt, checking if location is within the region.
    - VerifyAgeCommitment(commitment Commitment, ageProof AgeProof, revealedSalt string, minAge int): Verifies the age commitment against the age proof and revealed salt, checking if age is above the minimum age.
    - VerifyCombinedProof(payload ProofPayload, region string, minAge int): Verifies a combined proof payload, checking both location and age proofs.
    - CheckProofValidityPeriod(proofPayload ProofPayload, validUntilTimestamp int64): Verifies if the proof payload is still within a valid time period.
    - AnalyzeProofStrength(proofPayload ProofPayload): Analyzes the "strength" of the proof based on revealed information (illustrative - not cryptographically rigorous).
    - LogVerificationAttempt(payload ProofPayload, verificationResult bool, verifierID string): Logs a verification attempt with details for auditing purposes.
    - RejectProofIfCompromisedSalt(payload ProofPayload, compromisedSalts []string): Rejects a proof if the revealed salt is in a list of known compromised salts.
    - EnforceProofRequestPolicy(proofPayload ProofPayload, requiredProofTypes []ProofType): Enforces a policy that requires specific types of proofs to be present.

Data Structures:
    - Commitment: Represents a cryptographic commitment (hash).
    - LocationProof: Represents a proof related to location (simplified region assertion).
    - AgeProof: Represents a proof related to age (simplified age range assertion).
    - ProofPayload:  Encapsulates all components of a ZKP for transmission.
    - ProofType: Enum to represent different types of proofs requested/provided.

Note: This is a simplified and illustrative example to demonstrate ZKP concepts in Go. It does not implement a formally secure or efficient ZKP protocol like zk-SNARKs or STARKs. It focuses on demonstrating the *idea* of zero-knowledge proofs with 20+ functions as requested, showcasing various aspects like commitment, proof generation, verification, and some advanced (but simplified) concepts like selective disclosure and proof policies. For real-world secure ZKP applications, use established cryptographic libraries and protocols.

	// In this illustrative example, we are skipping actual location reconstruction and commitment re-computation as the 'proof' is just a boolean assertion about region.  A real ZKP would have a more complex proof structure.

We can't verify the *exact* location from the proof in this simplified example, but we can at least check the commitment is valid against *some* location if we had a hint.

	// In a *real* ZKP, the proof itself would allow you to verify the commitment without needing a hint and without revealing the actual location.
