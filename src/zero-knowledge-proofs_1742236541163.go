Outline and Function Summary:

Package: zkp_voting_system

This package implements a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) based decentralized voting system.
It allows voters to cast votes privately and verifiably without revealing their individual choices,
and ensures that only eligible voters can participate. The system leverages ZKP principles
to maintain voter privacy and election integrity.

Function Summary:

1.  `GenerateSystemParameters()`: Initializes and returns system-wide parameters necessary for ZKP computations.
2.  `RegisterVoter(params *SystemParameters, voterID string) (*Voter, error)`: Registers a new voter with the system, generating a unique identity and cryptographic keys.
3.  `InitializeElection(params *SystemParameters, electionID string, allowedVoters []string, questions []string) (*Election, error)`: Sets up a new election with specified parameters, eligible voters, and voting questions.
4.  `GetElectionStatus(election *Election) ElectionStatus`: Returns the current status of an election (e.g., setup, voting, closed, tallied).
5.  `CastVote(election *Election, voter *Voter, choices map[string]string) (*VoteProof, error)`: Allows a registered voter to cast their vote for the current election, generating a ZKP of valid vote without revealing the choices.
6.  `VerifyVoteProof(election *Election, voter *Voter, proof *VoteProof) (bool, error)`: Verifies the Zero-Knowledge Proof associated with a cast vote to ensure its validity and voter eligibility without revealing the vote itself.
7.  `RecordVerifiedVote(election *Election, voterID string, proof *VoteProof)`: Records a verified vote (only after successful proof verification) in the election system, associating it with the voter (anonymously if needed).
8.  `TallyVotes(election *Election) (map[string]map[string]int, error)`: Tallies the verified votes in an election to determine the results for each question, while maintaining vote privacy during the tallying process.
9.  `PublishElectionResults(election *Election) error`: Publishes the final election results, making them publicly accessible while preserving individual voter privacy.
10. `GetVoterEligibilityProof(election *Election, voter *Voter) (*EligibilityProof, error)`: Generates a Zero-Knowledge Proof of voter eligibility to participate in a specific election without revealing the voter's identity details beyond eligibility.
11. `VerifyVoterEligibilityProof(election *Election, voter *Voter, proof *EligibilityProof) (bool, error)`: Verifies the Zero-Knowledge Proof of voter eligibility to ensure the voter is authorized to participate in the election.
12. `RequestVoteReceipt(election *Election, voter *Voter) (*VoteReceipt, error)`: Generates a vote receipt for a voter after their vote is successfully cast and verified, allowing the voter to confirm their vote was recorded without compromising privacy.
13. `VerifyVoteReceipt(election *Election, voter *Voter, receipt *VoteReceipt) (bool, error)`: Verifies the vote receipt against the recorded vote to ensure authenticity and prevent tampering.
14. `ChallengeVoteProof(election *Election, voter *Voter, proof *VoteProof) (*ChallengeResponse, error)`: Allows an authorized party to challenge a specific vote proof, initiating an interactive ZKP protocol for deeper verification (for audit purposes).
15. `RespondToChallenge(election *Election, voter *Voter, challenge *ChallengeResponse) (*ResponseProof, error)`: Allows the voter to respond to a challenge with further proof elements to resolve the challenge.
16. `VerifyChallengeResponse(election *Election, voter *Voter, response *ResponseProof) (bool, error)`: Verifies the voter's response to the challenge, determining if the original vote proof is valid based on the interactive protocol.
17. `GenerateAuditTrail(election *Election) (*AuditTrail, error)`: Creates a publicly verifiable audit trail of the election process, including setup, voter registrations, vote submissions, verifications, and tallying, ensuring transparency without revealing individual votes.
18. `VerifyAuditTrail(election *Election, auditTrail *AuditTrail) (bool, error)`: Verifies the integrity and completeness of the election audit trail to confirm the election process was conducted honestly and transparently.
19. `RevokeVoterRegistration(params *SystemParameters, voterID string) error`: Revokes the registration of a voter, preventing them from participating in future elections.
20. `GetElectionStatistics(election *Election) (*ElectionStatistics, error)`: Provides aggregated, anonymized statistics about the election, such as total votes cast, participation rate, etc., without revealing individual voter data.

	// In a real ZKP, verification is based on the ZKP protocol's mathematical properties.

	// For this simplified example, we assume the vote data is implicitly known (or re-provided for verification in a real system).
	// In a real ZKP, the proof would demonstrate validity *without* revealing the vote data directly to the verifier.

	// In this simplified example, the "proof" is just the randomness. We need to reconstruct the original vote data to verify the commitment.
	// In a real system, the proof itself would be sufficient for verification without needing the original data again.
	// For simplicity, we assume in this example that the vote data is implicitly available for verification (e.g., for testing purposes).

	// **Important Note:** In a real ZKP voting system, the verification process would be fundamentally different.
	// The `proof.ProofData` would contain cryptographic elements that are used to mathematically verify the vote's validity
	// *without* needing to reconstruct the original vote choices or revealing the secret randomness.

	// For this demonstration, we are skipping the actual ZKP part for vote content privacy and focusing on the concept.
	// A real implementation would use libraries and protocols for actual ZKP.

	// In this simplified example, verification is always "true" to demonstrate the function call flow.

	// In a real ZKP system, tallying might also involve ZKP techniques to ensure tally integrity.
	// For this simplified example, we assume we can access the vote choices (which would not be the case in a true ZKP system for privacy).
	// To truly implement private tallying, homomorphic encryption or secure multi-party computation would be required.

	// For this simplified demonstration, we are skipping the ZKP for tallying and assuming we can access votes (for demonstration purposes only).
	// In a real ZKP system, the tallying process would be designed to work directly with the ZKP proofs without revealing individual votes.

	// **Important Note:**  This tallying is a placeholder for demonstration. In a real ZKP voting system,
	// tallying would be performed on encrypted votes or using ZKP-based aggregation techniques to maintain privacy.

// --- Important Notes on Real ZKP Implementation ---

// This code provides a conceptual outline and simplified function demonstrations.
// For a real-world ZKP voting system:

// 1. **Cryptographic Libraries:** Use robust cryptographic libraries for ZKP protocols (e.g., zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs, Sigma protocols).
// 2. **ZKP Protocols:** Implement actual Zero-Knowledge Proof protocols for:
//    - Vote validity: Proving the vote is valid (e.g., choice within allowed options) without revealing the choice.
//    - Voter eligibility: Proving the voter is authorized to vote without revealing their identity.
//    - Private Tallying: Tallying votes while keeping individual votes encrypted or protected using homomorphic encryption or secure multi-party computation techniques.
// 3. **Security Audits:** Rigorously audit the cryptographic implementation and protocols by security experts.
// 4. **Parameter Generation:** Securely generate and manage system parameters (e.g., prime numbers, generators, keys).
// 5. **Scalability and Performance:** Consider performance and scalability for handling a large number of voters and votes.
// 6. **Formal Verification:** For high-security applications, consider formal verification of the ZKP protocols.
// 7. **User Interface and Usability:** Design a user-friendly and secure interface for voters and election administrators.

// This example focuses on demonstrating the function structure and conceptual flow of a ZKP voting system in Go,
// but it is **not a secure or production-ready implementation** of ZKP. Real ZKP systems require deep cryptographic expertise and rigorous implementation.
