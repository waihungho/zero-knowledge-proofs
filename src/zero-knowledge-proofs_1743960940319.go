Outline and Function Summary:

Package zkp - Zero-Knowledge Proof Library in Go

This package provides a collection of Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) functions implemented in Go.
It explores advanced concepts and trendy applications of ZKP beyond basic authentication,
focusing on privacy-preserving computations and data integrity.

The functions are categorized into several areas:

1.  **Data Integrity and Provenance:**
    *   `ProveDataIntegrity(data, commitment, proof)`: Proves that the provided data corresponds to a given commitment without revealing the data itself.
    *   `ProveDataOrigin(originalDataHash, derivedData, proof)`: Proves that 'derivedData' was derived from data with hash 'originalDataHash' without revealing the original data.
    *   `ProveDataConsistency(data1Commitment, data2Commitment, relationProof)`: Proves a consistent relationship between two committed datasets (e.g., they are subsets, disjoint, or have some overlap) without revealing the datasets.
    *   `ProveDataTimestamp(dataHash, timestamp, oracleSignature)`: Proves that data with 'dataHash' existed at a specific 'timestamp' by relying on a trusted time oracle's signature.

2.  **Privacy-Preserving Computations:**
    *   `ProveSumInRange(numbersCommitments, sumRangeProof)`: Proves that the sum of a set of committed numbers falls within a specified range without revealing the numbers themselves.
    *   `ProveAverageValue(numbersCommitments, average, proof)`: Proves that the average of a set of committed numbers is a specific value 'average' without revealing the numbers.
    *   `ProvePolynomialEvaluation(coefficientsCommitment, x, yCommitment, proof)`: Proves that a committed polynomial, when evaluated at 'x', results in a value corresponding to 'yCommitment'.
    *   `ProveSetIntersectionEmpty(set1Commitment, set2Commitment, proof)`: Proves that the intersection of two committed sets is empty without revealing the sets.
    *   `ProveFunctionExecution(programHash, inputCommitment, outputCommitment, executionProof)`: Proves that a program with hash 'programHash', when executed on input corresponding to 'inputCommitment', produces output corresponding to 'outputCommitment', without revealing the program, input, or output.

3.  **Attribute and Property Verification:**
    *   `ProveAttributeInRange(attributeCommitment, rangeProof)`: Proves that a committed attribute (e.g., age, income) falls within a specified range without revealing the exact attribute value.
    *   `ProveAttributeSetMembership(attributeCommitment, allowedSetCommitment, membershipProof)`: Proves that a committed attribute belongs to a committed set of allowed values without revealing the attribute or the set itself.
    *   `ProveDataStructureProperty(dataCommitment, propertyProof)`: Proves that the data corresponding to 'dataCommitment' has a specific property (e.g., sorted order, balanced tree structure) without revealing the data.
    *   `ProveGraphConnectivity(graphCommitment, connectivityProof)`: Proves that a graph represented by 'graphCommitment' is connected without revealing the graph structure.
    *   `ProveKnowledgeOfSecretKey(publicKey, proof)`: Proves knowledge of the secret key corresponding to a given 'publicKey' without revealing the secret key itself (similar to Schnorr signature but used as a standalone ZKP).

4.  **Conditional and Threshold Proofs:**
    *   `ProveConditionalStatement(conditionCommitment, statementProof)`: Proves a statement is true only if a certain committed condition is met, otherwise, no information is revealed about the statement.
    *   `ProveThresholdValue(valuesCommitments, threshold, proof)`: Proves that at least a certain number of values in a set of commitments exceed a given 'threshold' without revealing which ones or their exact values.
    *   `ProveMajorityCondition(conditionsCommitments, majorityProof)`: Proves that a majority of committed boolean conditions are true without revealing which specific conditions are true.

5.  **Advanced ZKP Concepts Exploration:**
    *   `CreateRecursiveZKProof(initialProof, recursiveStepFunction, iterations)`: Demonstrates the concept of recursive ZKPs, where proofs are built upon previous proofs iteratively.
    *   `AggregateZKProofs(proofsList)`:  Explores proof aggregation techniques to combine multiple ZKPs into a single, more efficient proof.
    *   `ConvertZKProofFormat(proof, targetFormat)`: Illustrates interoperability by converting a ZKP from one format (e.g., Bulletproofs, STARKs, custom format) to another.
    *   `AnonymizeZKProof(proof, anonymityParameters)`:  Demonstrates how to add layers of anonymity to ZKPs, potentially using techniques like mixnets or verifiable shuffles.

Note: This is a conceptual outline and function summary.  The actual implementation of these functions would require significant cryptographic primitives, protocols, and potentially advanced ZKP techniques like zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, Bulletproofs, etc., depending on the desired efficiency, security, and complexity.  The functions are designed to be illustrative of the *kinds* of advanced and trendy applications ZKP can enable, not necessarily fully implementable in a simple, short code example.  Error handling, security considerations, and efficiency are simplified for conceptual clarity.
