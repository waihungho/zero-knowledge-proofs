/*
Outline and Function Summary:

This Go package demonstrates advanced concepts in Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) beyond basic demonstrations.
It focuses on creative and trendy applications, avoiding duplication of open-source implementations.

The package provides a suite of functions categorized into different ZKP use cases:

1. **Basic ZKP Primitives:**
    * `ProveKnowledgeOfDiscreteLog(secret, publicCommitment)`: Proves knowledge of a discrete logarithm without revealing the secret.
    * `ProveRange(value, min, max, commitment)`: Proves that a committed value lies within a specified range without revealing the value.
    * `ProveSetMembership(value, set, commitment)`: Proves that a committed value is a member of a given set without revealing the value.
    * `ProveNonMembership(value, set, commitment)`: Proves that a committed value is NOT a member of a given set without revealing the value.

2. **Advanced ZKP Applications for Data Privacy and Integrity:**
    * `ProveDataCorrectnessAgainstHash(data, hash, commitment)`: Proves that committed data corresponds to a given hash without revealing the data.
    * `ProveSumInRange(values, targetSum, min, max, commitments)`: Proves that the sum of committed values is within a range without revealing individual values.
    * `ProveProductInRange(values, targetProduct, min, max, commitments)`: Proves that the product of committed values is within a range without revealing individual values.
    * `ProveAverageValueInRange(values, targetAverage, tolerance, commitments)`: Proves that the average of committed values is within a tolerance range of a target average.
    * `ProveSortedOrder(values, commitments)`: Proves that committed values are in sorted order without revealing the values.
    * `ProveStatisticalProperty(data, propertyType, commitment)`: Proves a specific statistical property of committed data (e.g., mean, median, variance) without revealing the data itself.

3. **ZKPs for Secure Computation and Machine Learning:**
    * `ProveFunctionOutput(input, functionCode, output, commitment)`: Proves that the output of executing a given function on a hidden input is a specific value.
    * `ProveModelPredictionAccuracy(modelParameters, inputData, predictedOutput, accuracyThreshold, commitments)`: Proves that a machine learning model's prediction accuracy on hidden input data meets a threshold without revealing the model or data.
    * `ProveFairnessInAlgorithm(algorithmCode, inputData, output, fairnessMetric, threshold, commitment)`: Proves that an algorithm executed on hidden input data satisfies a fairness metric above a threshold.
    * `ProveDifferentialPrivacyCompliance(data, query, privacyBudget, queryResult, commitment)`: Proves that a query result on hidden data is achieved with differential privacy within a specified budget.

4. **ZKPs for Decentralized Systems and Identity:**
    * `ProveUniqueIdentity(identityData, commitment)`: Proves that an identity is unique (e.g., not double-registered) without revealing the identity itself.
    * `ProveCapabilityAuthorization(capabilityToken, resourceID, commitment)`: Proves possession of a capability token authorizing access to a resource without revealing the token.
    * `ProveLocationProximity(locationData, proximityRange, targetLocation, commitment)`: Proves that a location is within a certain proximity of a target location without revealing the exact location.
    * `ProveDataFreshness(timestampedData, freshnessThreshold, commitment)`: Proves that data is fresh (within a certain timestamp threshold) without revealing the data or timestamp directly.
    * `ProveComplianceWithPolicy(data, policyRules, commitment)`: Proves that data complies with a set of policy rules without revealing the data itself.
    * `ProveSecureMultiPartyComputationResult(inputs, functionCode, result, commitments)`: Proves the correctness of a secure multi-party computation result without revealing individual inputs.

These functions utilize advanced ZKP concepts and explore applications in data privacy, secure computation, machine learning fairness, decentralized systems, and identity management. They are designed to be conceptually illustrative and would require underlying cryptographic libraries for full implementation in a real-world scenario.  The focus is on demonstrating the *potential* and *versatility* of ZKPs in innovative and modern contexts.

**Explanation and Key Concepts:**

1.  **Outline and Summary:** The code starts with a detailed outline and summary of the functions, categorizing them into basic primitives, data privacy/integrity, secure computation/ML, and decentralized systems/identity. This provides a high-level understanding of the package's scope.

2.  **Conceptual Implementations:**  Crucially, the functions are designed as *conceptual* implementations.  They do *not* contain actual secure cryptographic ZKP protocols. Instead, they illustrate the *idea* of what each ZKP function aims to achieve.

    *   **`ProveKnowledgeOfDiscreteLog` Example:** This function shows a simplified version of the Schnorr protocol for proving knowledge of a discrete logarithm. It outlines the prover-verifier interaction steps (commitment, challenge, response, verification) but uses insecure random number generation and simplified modular arithmetic for demonstration.
    *   **Other Functions:** The other functions similarly provide a high-level description of the ZKP goal and a simplified (often non-ZKP) check to illustrate the intended functionality.  They use comments to indicate where real cryptographic ZKP techniques would be needed (e.g., Bulletproofs for range proofs, SNARKs/STARKs for verifiable computation, etc.).

3.  **Advanced and Trendy Applications:** The function names and descriptions target "advanced, trendy, and creative" areas:

    *   **Data Privacy:** Range proofs, set membership, statistical property proofs, data correctness against hash.
    *   **Secure Computation and ML:** Function output proofs, model prediction accuracy proofs, fairness proofs, differential privacy compliance proofs.
    *   **Decentralized Systems and Identity:** Unique identity proofs, capability authorization proofs, location proximity proofs, data freshness proofs, policy compliance proofs, SMPC result proofs.

4.  **No Duplication of Open Source:** The functions are designed to be conceptually unique and not direct copies of common open-source ZKP examples. They focus on application-level use cases rather than just basic cryptographic primitives.

5.  **Helper Functions:** The `Helper Functions` section contains simplified and insecure placeholder functions for hashing, distance calculation, timestamp extraction, etc. These are purely for illustrative purposes within the conceptual examples and are *not* meant for real cryptographic use.

6.  **Example Usage (`main` function):** The `main` function provides a basic example of how to call `ProveKnowledgeOfDiscreteLog` and `ProveRange`. It's a conceptual usage example and would not represent a secure ZKP application in its current form.

**Important Limitations and Real-World Considerations:**

*   **Security:** The provided code is **not secure** and **not a real ZKP implementation**. It is purely for conceptual demonstration.  Real ZKP implementations require rigorous cryptographic protocols, secure random number generation, and established cryptographic libraries.
*   **Efficiency:** Real ZKP protocols can be computationally expensive. The efficiency and practicality of different ZKP techniques vary greatly.
*   **Cryptographic Libraries:** To build real ZKP applications in Go, you would need to use robust cryptographic libraries (e.g., libraries for elliptic curve cryptography, pairing-based cryptography, SNARK/STARK frameworks, etc.).
*   **Complexity:** Designing and implementing secure and efficient ZKP protocols is a complex task requiring deep cryptographic expertise.

**In summary, this code provides a conceptual outline and function summary for a Go package demonstrating advanced ZKP applications. It serves as a starting point for understanding the potential of ZKPs in various modern contexts but is not a production-ready ZKP library.** To build real ZKP systems, you would need to delve into specific ZKP protocols, cryptographic libraries, and security best practices.
