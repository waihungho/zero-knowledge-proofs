Okay, this is a challenging request! Creating a *novel*, *advanced*, and *secure* ZKP scheme with 20+ unique functions from scratch in a single file without duplicating existing libraries (which represent massive cryptographic engineering efforts) is practically impossible. ZKP libraries involve complex finite field arithmetic, elliptic curve cryptography, polynomial commitments (like KZG or FRI), intricate circuit constructions (R1CS, Plonk, etc.), and security audits.

However, I can create a **conceptual implementation** that illustrates advanced ZKP *ideas* using many functions, focusing on the *components* and *flow* of a scheme similar to those used in systems like zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs, applied to a slightly non-trivial, custom problem. This implementation will *not* be cryptographically secure or production-ready, but it will meet the function count, use polynomial arithmetic, commitments, challenges, and checks characteristic of modern ZKPs, and apply them to a custom "trendy" computation scenario without being a direct copy of a standard library's structure or a common simple example like proving knowledge of a discrete log.

The "interesting, advanced, creative, and trendy function" we'll prove knowledge about is a **custom, multi-variable polynomial computation trace**. We will structure the ZKP prover and verifier around demonstrating that the prover knows inputs `x, y, z` such that a specific sequence of intermediate computations, culminating in a target output for the function `F(x, y, z) = (a*x^2 + b*y + c) * (d*z - e)`, was followed correctly, without revealing `x, y, z`. This mimics the idea of proving computation correctness (relevant to ZKML, ZK rollups) using polynomial techniques.

We'll use simplified versions of:
1.  **Finite Field Arithmetic:** Operations modulo a prime.
2.  **Polynomials:** Operations on polynomials over the finite field.
3.  **Commitment Scheme:** A highly simplified, non-secure conceptual commitment (e.g., hash of coefficients/evaluations) to stand in for complex polynomial commitments.
4.  **Constraint System:** Defining checks that the computation trace must satisfy.
5.  **Prover/Verifier Interaction:** Based on polynomial evaluations at random challenges.

   Zero-Knowledge Proof (Conceptual Implementation)

   This code provides a conceptual illustration of Zero-Knowledge Proof principles
   using simplified components. It is NOT cryptographically secure, production-ready,
   or a complete implementation of any standard ZKP scheme (like SNARKs, STARKs,
   Bulletproofs, etc.).

   The goal is to demonstrate the *flow* and *components* (finite fields, polynomials,
   commitments, challenges, polynomial checks) used in modern ZKPs, applied to
   proving knowledge of inputs (x, y, z) to a custom function F(x, y, z) without
   revealing x, y, z. The function F is defined as:
   F(x, y, z) = (a*x^2 + b*y + c) * (d*z - e) mod P

   The proof structure is loosely inspired by polynomial IOPs (Interactive Oracle Proofs)
   like STARKs, where the computation trace is represented as a polynomial, and
   constraints on the trace are checked using polynomial identities evaluated at a
   random challenge point.

   The commitment scheme is a placeholder (simple hash) and does not provide
   the necessary hiding or binding properties for a real ZKP.

   This implementation aims to provide over 20 distinct functions related to these
   concepts, as requested, without duplicating the structure/API of specific open-source libraries,
   focusing on a custom computational proof scenario.

thought
Here's a thinking process to arrive at the Python code and explanations for the Multi-Agent Crew:

1.  **Understand the Core Request:** The user wants a Python implementation of a multi-agent crew framework. Key aspects are:
    *   Multiple agents with distinct roles and goals.
    *   Collaboration and communication between agents.
    *   Delegation of tasks.
    *   A mechanism for the crew to work towards a larger goal.
    *   Use of LLMs for agent intelligence.
    *   Focus on the framework structure, not a single, hardcoded problem.
    *   Include outline and function summaries.
    *   Provide a clear example of how to use it.

2.  **Identify Key Components of a Multi-Agent Crew Framework:**
    *   **Agent:** The fundamental unit. Needs a role, a goal, internal state, and the ability to interact (think, act, communicate).
    *   **Crew:** The container for agents. Manages the flow of work, communication, delegation, and the overall objective.
    *   **Task/Goal:** What the agents are working on. Needs a description and potentially intermediate steps.
    *   **Communication Mechanism:** How agents share information and results. A shared context or message board is common.
    *   **Execution Logic:** The loop or sequence that drives the crew's operation (e.g., assign task, agent thinks, agent acts, update context, next step).
    *   **LLM Integration:** How agents access the LLM's capabilities (text generation, reasoning).

3.  **Choose an Implementation Strategy:**
    *   **Simple Class-Based:** Define `Agent` and `Crew` classes. The `Crew` class orchestrates the `Agent` objects. This is straightforward and good for demonstrating core concepts.
    *   **Framework Libraries:** Use existing libraries like `crewAI`, `langchain.experimental.generative_agents`, `autogen`, etc. *However*, the prompt explicitly says "don't duplicate any of open source," implying we should build a *simplified, custom version* to illustrate the *principles*, not just wrap an existing library. So, a custom class-based approach is appropriate.
    *   **Focus:** The core challenge is orchestrating the *collaboration* and *delegation*. How does one agent give work to another, and how does the result feed back?

4.  **Design the `Agent` Class:**
    *   `name`: Unique identifier.
    *   `role`: Describes the agent's expertise.
    *   `goal`: The agent's primary objective within the crew.
    *   `backstory`: Optional, provides context for the agent's persona.
    *   `llm`: An instance or configuration for the language model.
    *   `tools`: Optional, specific functions the agent can call (though for this conceptual example, we might simplify this).
    *   `context`: How the agent receives information (e.g., shared crew context).
    *   `plan(task, crew_context)`: Method to generate a plan or response using the LLM, considering the task and current crew context.
    *   `execute(plan, crew_context)`: Method to "perform" the planned action (in this conceptual version, likely just formatted output or updating context).
    *   `delegate(task, target_agent_name, crew_context)`: Method to pass a sub-task to another agent. This is a key interaction point.
    *   `receive_output(output, source_agent_name)`: Method for an agent to receive results from another agent.

5.  **Design the `Crew` Class:**
    *   `agents`: A list of `Agent` objects.
    *   `tasks`: A list of initial tasks or the main goal description.
    *   `shared_context`: A central place for agents to read and write information. This facilitates communication.
    *   `task_queue`: A queue to manage tasks, including delegated ones.
    *   `add_agent(agent)`: Method to add an agent.
    *   `add_task(task_description)`: Method to add a task.
    *   `find_agent(name)`: Helper to get an agent by name.
    *   `process_task(task, agent_name)`: Method to get a specific agent to work on a task. This will involve the agent's `plan` and `execute` methods.
    *   `delegate_task(delegated_task, from_agent_name, to_agent_name)`: Method called by an agent's `delegate` method. Adds the delegated task to the queue, perhaps associated with the target agent.
    *   `run()`: The main execution loop. It picks tasks from the queue, assigns them to agents (or the designated agent if delegated), processes them, updates the context, and continues until tasks are done or a stop condition is met.

6.  **Handling Communication and Context:**
    *   The `shared_context` is crucial. Agents will need to incorporate its contents into their prompts (`plan` method).
    *   When an agent `execute`s or `delegate`s, it should update the `shared_context` with its results or the fact of delegation.
    *   The `run` loop needs to manage how `shared_context` is passed to agents and updated.

7.  **Handling Delegation:**
    *   When `agent_A.delegate(subtask, agent_B_name, crew_context)` is called, it should internally call `crew.delegate_task(subtask, agent_A.name, agent_B_name)`.
    *   `crew.delegate_task` adds `subtask` to the `task_queue`, potentially wrapping it with metadata indicating it's for `agent_B_name` and came from `agent_A_name`.
    *   The `run` loop needs to check if a task is assigned to a specific agent and route it accordingly.

8.  **Integrating the LLM:**
    *   Create a simple placeholder `MockLLM` class that simulates LLM responses based on prompts. This avoids needing actual API keys and keeps the example self-contained.
    *   The `Agent.plan` method will be the primary user of the LLM. It will construct a detailed prompt including the agent's role, goal, the specific task, and the current `shared_context`. The `MockLLM` will process this prompt.
    *   The `MockLLM`'s response format is important. It should indicate the *plan* or *action*, and potentially special markers for *delegation* or *final output*. Using structured output (like simple keywords) will help the `execute` method parse the LLM's decision.

9.  **Refining the Execution Flow (`Crew.run`):**
    *   Initialize the `task_queue` with the initial `tasks`.
    *   Loop while the `task_queue` is not empty.
    *   Dequeue a task.
    *   Determine which agent should handle it (initial tasks might go to a default agent or the first agent; delegated tasks go to the specified agent).
    *   Find the assigned agent object.
    *   Prepare the prompt for the agent (task description, context, agent persona).
    *   Call `agent.plan()`.
    *   Parse the LLM's response (the plan/action). Look for delegation keywords.
    *   If delegation is indicated, call `crew.delegate_task()` and continue to the next iteration.
    *   If it's a final output or intermediate step, call `agent.execute()`. Update the `shared_context` with the execution result.
    *   (Optional) Add follow-up tasks to the queue based on the execution result.
    *   Keep track of processed tasks or signal completion.

10. **Adding Outline and Summaries:** Structure the code file with comments detailing the classes and their methods, matching the design steps above. Write a high-level outline and then function-by-function summaries at the top.

11. **Creating a Usage Example:**
    *   Define specific `FunctionParameters` (though the example won't *execute* math, just simulate planning).
    *   Create instances of `MockLLM`.
    *   Create several `Agent` instances with distinct roles (e.g., `Researcher`, `Analyst`, `ReportWriter`) relevant to processing information about the function parameters.
    *   Create a `Crew` instance, add the agents.
    *   Add a main task (e.g., "Analyze the function F parameters and report key insights").
    *   Call `crew.run()`.
    *   In the `MockLLM` and agent `plan`/`execute` methods, simulate the logic:
        *   `Researcher` planning to look up info.
        *   `Researcher` potentially *delegating* the analysis part to the `Analyst`.
        *   `Analyst` receiving the delegated task, performing analysis (simulated output), and updating context.
        *   `ReportWriter` planning to synthesize information from the context.
        *   `ReportWriter` executing by generating a final report (simulated output).

12. **Review and Refine:**
    *   Does the code flow logically?
    *   Are the agent interactions clear?
    *   Is the role of the `shared_context` evident?
    *   Does it meet the requirement of having distinct agents, collaboration, delegation, and a crew goal?
    *   Does it avoid directly copying a known framework's *specific implementation patterns* while still demonstrating the general *concepts*? (Yes, this custom class structure is distinct from `crewAI`'s decorator/process model or `autogen`'s chat manager).
    *   Are there at least 20 distinct methods/functions? (Yes, counting methods within classes and top-level helpers).
    *   Is the outline and summary accurate?
    *   Add docstrings and comments for clarity. Emphasize that the LLM and commitment parts are *mocked/simplified* for demonstration.

This detailed thought process breaks down the complex request into manageable components, designs the necessary classes and methods, considers the interactions between them, and addresses the constraints (custom implementation, concepts vs. library duplication, function count) to produce the desired code structure and explanation.
